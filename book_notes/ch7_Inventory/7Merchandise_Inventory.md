# Merchandise Inventory

- This chapter discusses inventory accounting, inventory management and how decisions involving inventory accounting affect financial statements.
- __Inventory__: items held for sale in the ordinary course of business.
- Inventory is important for retailers and manufacturers.

- Proper inventory management can lead to better quality control, lower prices for customers, better service (shipping and handling), and more profit.
  - If your inventory management isn't good, consider shrinking the inventory itself.

- Shareholders, creditors, auditors and managers all care about inventory:
  - Shareholders to profit off inventory and how managers acquire, carry and sell inventory.
  - creditors to ensure the company can meet its financial obligations, using inventory as collateral if necessary.
  - auditors ensure inventory is reported accurately using GAAP. Inventory can indicate going concern issuse
  - Managers to ensure that inventories are acquired (or manufactured) and carried at a reasonable cost.

- You need enough inventory to meet consumer demands, but too much inventory is costly.

## The Relative Size of Inventories

- some industries have larger inventories than others.
  - banks have small inventories. retailers have large inventories.

- shorter inventory turnovers reduce the cost of holding inventory.

## Accounting for Inventory: Four Important Issues

- Inventory lifecycle:
  1. Inventory is bought
  2. Inventory is carried on the balance sheet
  3. inventory is sold and is recorded on the income statement
  4. The period ends and remaining inventory is accounted for as ending inventory.

- The rest of the ch covers the life cycle in that order.

## Inventory Valuation and Net Income: An Example of Counterbalancing

- Cost of Goods Sold = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory
- Net Income = Sales - Cost of Goods Sold
- The above equations can interact in interesting ways.

- __counterbalancing effect__: Accounting choices that affect assets (or liabilities) and net income in the current period tend to reverse themselves across time.
  - From this we learn accounting periods are *not* independent of each other.
  - For example, a period's ending inventory is subtracted from COGS and added to Net Income in the current period, then added to COGS and subtracted from Net Income through beginning inventory in the next period.

- Because inventory affects Net Income, it's often used for fraud.

## Acquiring Inventory What Costs to Capitalize?

- Inventory is capitalized (because it provides future benefits) when bought and realized when sold.
  - matching principle

- To determine the total inventory value to capitalize then realize:
  1. count the items
  2. multiply the count by the cost per item

### What items or Units to Include?

- There's a general rule for which inventory items to include, but application of it can be get complicated.

#### General Rule

- Inventory includes items that:
  - are being held for sale
  - The company has complete and unrestricted ownership of. Meaning:
    - The company bears the complete loss if the inventory is lost, stole, or destroyed
    - The company owns all rights to the benefits produced by the items.

- For companies in physical possession of all their inventories and only their inventories, counting inventories a simple physical count. For companies with Consignments and Goods in Transit, this is not the case.

#### Consignments

- __Consignment__: agreement by a consignee to pay a consignor for consigned goods after the goods are sold.
  - The consignee charges a markup for the consigned goods, and keeps it as profit.

- Although the consignee physically possesses consigned goods, the consignor records consigned goods on their balance sheet, not the consignee.

#### Goods in Transit

- Ideally exchanges of inventory are recorded when ownership changes from seller to buyer. Determining when the ownership changes on shipped inventory can get complicated.
- If the accounting period isn't ending, goods in transit are recorded by the seller when they are shipped and by the buyer when they are received.

- If the period ends while goods are in transit, the buyer and seller must agree on who owns the goods while they are in transit then record the sale when the ownership changes. The following shipping contract terms can help with this:
  - __FOB (free on board) shipping point__: indicates the buyer owns the product in transit.
  - FOB (free on board) destination__: indicates the seller owns the product in transit

### What Costs to Attach?

- aka valuing capitalized inventory.
- applies to purchases and manufacturing.

#### General Rule

- Capitalize all costs incurred to prepare inventory for sale.
  - includes: manufacturing, acquisition, storage, shipping (aka freight-in or transportation-in), and packaging.

- manufacturing costs are discussed further.

#### Determining the Costs of Manufacturing Inventories

- __Retail companies__ don't manufacture, they just resell manufactured goods at a markup.
  - Their capitalized inventory costs only include:
    - purchase cost
    - freight-in
  - These capitalized inventory costs are debited to Inventory (+A) and credited to Cash (-A).

- __Manufacturing companies__ buy *raw materials*, then use *processes involving labor* and *other costs* to manufacture their inventories.
  - Their capitalized inventory costs only include all costs required to bring the inventory to a sellable condition:
    - acquiring raw materials
    - manufacturing labor (direct costs)
    - __overhead__ (supporting costs) including:
      - indirect materials (e.g. cleaning supplies)
      - indirect labor (e.g. manager salaries)
      - depreciation of fixed assets
      - utility and insurance costs

- Manufacturing companies use the inventory account more than retailers because their main business is bringing inventory to a sellable condition. Costs like depreciation, wages and salaries, rent, and insurance are often capitalized as part of the inventory cost and matched to sales. This gives managers leeway in reporting, and hence an opportunity to report fraudulently.

## Carrying Inventory: Perpetual Method vs. Periodic Method

- Companies with a __perpetual inventory__ system keep a running tally of their inventory, then periodically reconsile the tally with a physical count.
  - Along with the inventory tally, companies keep a running balance in the inventory and cost of goods sold accounts
  - Differences in the running tally and physical counts can indicate inventory control problems.
    - These differences are recorded in the Inventory loss (E, -RE) account against Inventory (-A)
  - Tallies are often kept in a database and altered on sales to customers and purchases from suppliers.
  - Physical counts require you to stop selling.
  - In this method, inventory discrepancies

- In the __Periodic inventory method__, inventories are calculated periodically (at the end of the period)
  - According to the book, in this method the tally of beginning inventory isn't kept so it can't be compared to the tally of ending inventory to ensure the full amount of money was collected from the goods sold.
