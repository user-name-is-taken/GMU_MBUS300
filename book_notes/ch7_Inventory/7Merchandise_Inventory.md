# Merchandise Inventory

- This chapter discusses inventory accounting, inventory management and how decisions involving inventory accounting affect financial statements.
- __Inventory__: items held for sale in the ordinary course of business.
- Inventory is important for retailers and manufacturers.

- Proper inventory management can lead to better quality control, lower prices for customers, better service (shipping and handling), and more profit.
  - If your inventory management isn't good, consider shrinking the inventory itself.

- Shareholders, creditors, auditors and managers all care about inventory:
  - Shareholders to profit off inventory and how managers acquire, carry and sell inventory.
  - creditors to ensure the company can meet its financial obligations, using inventory as collateral if necessary.
  - auditors ensure inventory is reported accurately using GAAP. Inventory can indicate going concern issuse
  - Managers to ensure that inventories are acquired (or manufactured) and carried at a reasonable cost.

- You need enough inventory to meet consumer demands, but too much inventory is costly.

## The Relative Size of Inventories

- some industries have larger inventories than others.
  - banks have small inventories. retailers have large inventories.

- shorter inventory turnovers reduce the cost of holding inventory.

## Accounting for Inventory: Four Important Issues

- Inventory lifecycle:
  1. Inventory is bought
  2. Inventory is carried on the balance sheet
  3. inventory is sold and is recorded on the income statement
  4. The period ends and remaining inventory is accounted for as ending inventory.

- The rest of the ch covers the life cycle in that order.

## Inventory Valuation and Net Income: An Example of Counterbalancing

- Cost of Goods Sold = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory
- Net Income = Sales - Cost of Goods Sold
- The above equations can interact in interesting ways.

- __counterbalancing effect__: Accounting choices that affect assets (or liabilities) and net income in the current period tend to reverse themselves across time.
  - From this we learn accounting periods are *not* independent of each other.
  - For example, a period's ending inventory is subtracted from COGS and added to Net Income in the current period, then added to COGS and subtracted from Net Income through beginning inventory in the next period.

- Because inventory affects Net Income, it's often used for fraud.

## Acquiring Inventory What Costs to Capitalize?

- Inventory is capitalized (because it provides future benefits) when bought and realized when sold.
  - matching principle

- To determine the total inventory value to capitalize then realize:
  1. count the items
  2. multiply the count by the cost per item

### What items or Units to Include?

- There's a general rule for which inventory items to include, but application of it can be get complicated.

#### General Rule

- Inventory includes items that:
  - are being held for sale
  - The company has complete and unrestricted ownership of. Meaning:
    - The company bears the complete loss if the inventory is lost, stole, or destroyed
    - The company owns all rights to the benefits produced by the items.

- For companies in physical possession of all their inventories and only their inventories, counting inventories a simple physical count. For companies with Consignments and Goods in Transit, this is not the case.

#### Consignments

- __Consignment__: agreement by a consignee to pay a consignor for consigned goods after the goods are sold.
  - The consignee charges a markup for the consigned goods, and keeps it as profit.

- Although the consignee physically possesses consigned goods, the consignor records consigned goods on their balance sheet, not the consignee.

#### Goods in Transit

- Ideally exchanges of inventory are recorded when ownership changes from seller to buyer. Determining when the ownership changes on shipped inventory can get complicated.
- If the accounting period isn't ending, goods in transit are recorded by the seller when they are shipped and by the buyer when they are received.

- If the period ends while goods are in transit, the buyer and seller must agree on who owns the goods while they are in transit then record the sale when the ownership changes. The following shipping contract terms can help with this:
  - __FOB (free on board) shipping point__: indicates the buyer owns the product in transit.
  - FOB (free on board) destination__: indicates the seller owns the product in transit

### What Costs to Attach?

- aka valuing capitalized inventory.
- applies to purchases and manufacturing.

#### General Rule

- Capitalize all costs incurred to prepare inventory for sale.
  - includes: manufacturing, acquisition, storage, shipping (aka freight-in or transportation-in), and packaging.

- manufacturing costs are discussed further.

#### Determining the Costs of Manufacturing Inventories

- __Retail companies__ don't manufacture, they just resell manufactured goods at a markup.
  - Their capitalized inventory costs only include:
    - purchase cost
    - freight-in
  - These capitalized inventory costs are debited to Inventory (+A) and credited to Cash (-A).

- __Manufacturing companies__ buy *raw materials*, then use *processes involving labor* and *other costs* to manufacture their inventories.
  - Their capitalized inventory costs only include all costs required to bring the inventory to a sellable condition:
    - acquiring raw materials
    - manufacturing labor (direct costs)
    - __overhead__ (supporting costs) including:
      - indirect materials (e.g. cleaning supplies)
      - indirect labor (e.g. manager salaries)
      - depreciation of fixed assets
      - utility and insurance costs

- Manufacturing companies use the inventory account more than retailers because their main business is bringing inventory to a sellable condition. Costs like depreciation, wages and salaries, rent, and insurance are often capitalized as part of the inventory cost and matched to sales. This gives managers leeway in reporting, and hence an opportunity to report fraudulently.

## Carrying Inventory: Perpetual Method vs. Periodic Method

- Companies with a __perpetual inventory__ system keep a running tally of their inventory, then periodically reconsile the tally with a physical count.
  - Along with the inventory tally, companies keep a running balance in the inventory and cost of goods sold accounts
  - Differences in the running tally and physical counts can indicate inventory control problems.
    - These differences are recorded in the Inventory loss (E, -RE) account against Inventory (-A)
  - Tallies are often kept in a database and altered on sales to customers and purchases from suppliers.
  - Physical counts require you to stop selling.
  - In this method, inventory discrepancies

- In the __Periodic inventory method__, inventories are calculated periodically (at the end of the period)
  - According to the book, in this method the tally of beginning inventory isn't kept so it can't be compared to the tally of ending inventory to ensure the full amount of money was collected from the goods sold.

## Selling Inventory: Which Cost Flow Assumption?

- To calculate cost of goods sold you must assign a value to the items sold from the values of items purchased.

- Use one of the following 3 cost flow assumptions to assign values to inventories sold:
  - averaging
  - first-in, first-out (FIFO)
  - last-in, last-out (LIFO)
    - IFRS prohibits this.

### Specific Identification

- With perpetual inventory or with large-ticket items you can use the __specific identification__ method. In specific identification, identify which items were sold and which remain, then record the actual cost of the item when you sell it.

- In these cases you simply apply the formula with the actual values:
  - Cost of Goods Sold = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory

- The journal entries for selling inventories are:
  - Debit cash (+A), credit sales (R, +RE)
  - Debit COGS (E, -RE), credit Inventory (-A)

- In specific identification managers can manipulate net income by selling cheaper or more expensive inventories at a certain times.

### Three Inventory Cost Flow Assumptions: Average, FIFO, and LIFO

- When you can't specifically assign costs to goods sold, make one of the following cost flow assumptions.

- __Average assumption__: the cost assigned to goods sold is the average cost of units available for sale at the time of sale.
  - average cost of units available = total inventory $ / inventory count

- __First-in, first-out (FIFO) assumption__: the oldest available inventory costs are assigned to COGS.

- __Last-in, First-out (LIFO) assumption__: the most recent inventory costs are assigned to COGS.

### Inventory Cost Flow Assumptions: Effect on the Financial Statements

- __LIFO conformity rule__: If a company uses LIFO for calculating its tax liability, it must also use LIFO for preparing its financial statements.
  - This is because inflation causes LIFO to result in lower estimates.
  - This is a federal income tax law.

### Choosing an Inventory Cost Flow Assumption: Trade-offs

- breakdown: 33% LIFO, 63% FIFO, 23% average
- Many companies, especially international companies, use a mix of these.
- The inventory cost flow assumption doesn't necessarily reflect how the inventory is physically sold.
- Changing cost flow assumptions is difficult as it violates the consistency principle. To change assumptions you must: get auditor approval, disclose it in footnotes, restate prior year's statements.

- cost flow assumption trade-offs include:
  - accuracy of income and asset measurement
  - economic consequences

#### Income and Asset Measurement

- FIFO matches sales revenues to the most old expenses, leaving new inventory expenses on the balance sheet. This produces the most current measure of inventory on the balance sheet.

- LIFO matches against new expenses, leaving old expenses in the account. Because of this, over time, LIFO can give rise to grossly outdated inventory costs. These inaccuracies are reflected in:
  - net worth
  - inventory turnover

#### Economic Consequences

- cost flow assumptions affect:
  - income taxes and liquidity problems
  - bookkeeping costs
  - LIFO liquidations and purchasing practices
  - debt and compensation contracts
  - the capital market

##### Income Taxes and Liquidity

- Higher cost of inventories (due to inflation) in LIFO yield lower net income, and hence, lower taxes.
- On the flip side, FIFO makes net income look higher creating __paper profits__ that make the company look good, but don't reflect actual cash flows and can hide liquidity problems.

##### Bookkeeping Costs

- LIFO is generally more difficult for bookkeepers, and hence more costly.
  - LIFO is harder because companies might have to cary old inventories for long periods of time.

##### LIFO Liquidation and Inventory Purchasing Practices

- To record against old inventories, companies using LIFO must reduce their total amount of inventory. As discussed, this causes higher net income. Companies will do this when the selling price of those inventories goes down to match low selling price to low buying price. While not fraudulent, this is misleading.
- To do this LIFO inventory trick, companies must have a reserve of inventories. Low inventory turnovers, with large amounts of inventories can indicate inventory reserves.

##### Debt and Compensation Contracts

- The higher levels of net income reported by FIFO are attractive to managers because:
  - manager's salaries are sometimes based on net income
  - debt covenants are sometimes based on net income

- Remember, FIFO only produces higher net income when prices of goods going up.

##### The Capital Market

- The higher levels of net income reported by FIFO put a company in a better financing position because:
  - higher net income can improve credit rating, higher credit rating can mean better terms on loans.
  - higher income can allow the company to sell stocks for a higher price
    - This is debated.

- The benefits of FIFO come at the loss of LIFO tax savings.
- Companies that use LIFO must report what their income would have been under FIFO.

##### The LIFO Reverse: A User Perspective

- __LIFO reserve__ = FIFO assumption net income - LIFO assumption net income
- you can use the above formula to calculate any of the numbers in it.
- By calculating the FIFO net income, you can calculate how much tax would have been if a LIFO company used FIFO. From this, you can figure out how much the LIFO company saves in taxes by using LIFO.

- You can figure out what LIFO a company's FIFO net income would be if they switched to FIFO in the previous period by multiplying the change in the LIFO reserve (from last year to this year) by 1 minus the effective tax rate, and then adding that amount to net income reported under LIFO.
  - LIFO Net Income + Increase in LIFO Reserve * (1 - Tax Rate) = FIFO Net Income

## Ending Inventory: Applying the Lower-of-Cost-or-Market Rule

- Inventory is recorded at the Lower-of-Cost-or-Market rule dictates.

- If the cost of inventory was more than the current market value, the inventory must be adjusted.
  - One way to adjust inventory is to debit an Inventory loss (Lo, -RE) against an inventory (-A) credit.

- market value is different in GAAP and IFRS:
  - GAAP: the market value is the replacement cost, or the cost of replacing the inventory
  - IFRS: the market value is normally the realizable value, the amount at which hte inventory could be sold.

- In IFRS, if the value of written-down inventory increases, an __inventory recovery__ is recorded to bring the value back to its original cost.
  - GAAP doesn't allow this.

## The Lower-of-Cost-or-Market Rule and Hidden Reserves

- The Lower-of-Cost-or-Market rule allows companies to create hidden reserves by adjusting inventories down in periods when net income is high, then selling the inventories for a large gain later.
- Companies have a lot of freedom in reducing the value of inventories because market value is subjective.
- Even though the conservatism principle can be abused to create hidden reserves, it's better than companies being able to overstate income.

## International Perspective: Japanese Business and Inventory Accounting

- Japaneese companies act more cohesively than American companies. This allows them to better plan inventory stocking, and reduce how much inventory they carry (even implementing JIT inventory). Because they have less inventory managing it isn't that important and they just use the average assumption (not LIFO or FIFO).
  - The companies buy stock in each other to prove allegance to the group.

- Japan uses IFRS
