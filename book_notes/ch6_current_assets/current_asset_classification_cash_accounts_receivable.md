# Ch 6 The Current Asset Classification, Cash, and Accounts Receivable

- Not all receivables are collectable. For example, in the 2008 housing crisis, uncollectable mortgage receivables crashed the US economy.

- sections of this chapter:
  - __section 1__: current asset classification and the measures of solvency and liquidity that use current assets. The dollar amounts in the cash and accounts receivable accounts make up an important part of current assets and are therefore important components of these measures
  - __sections 2 and 3__: definitions, disclosure rules, and methods of accounting for cash and accounts receivable
  - __section 4__: managing receivables expressed in foreign currencies, and a discussion of the link between receivables management and return on equity

## The Current Asset Classification

- __current asset__: an asset that will become cash (consumed) within the longer of a year or the company's __operating cycle__
  - __operating cycle__: the time it takes to convert cash to inventory (purchase or manufacture), sell the inventory, then collect cash from the sale.

- Because the operating cycle varies greatly, current assets can vary greatly.
  - For example grocery stores have short operating cycles, but plane manufacturers have very long operating cycles

- Accounts included in current assets (not an exhaustive list, but pretty exhaustive):
  - cash
  - short-term investments
  - short-term accounts and notes receivable
  - inventories
  - prepaid expenses

### The Relative Size of Current Assets across Industries

- Industries differ greatly in how large their current assets are:
  - banks have large current assets, because they carry large current receivables.
  - Some businesses, like hotel companies don't carry large amounts of current assets.

### Measures Using Current Assets: Working Captial, Current Ration, and Quick Ratio

- Current assets and current liabilities are compared in the following ratios (from ch 5) which measure a company's solvency:
  - __working capital__
  - __current ratio__
  - __quick ratio__

- Some companies can afford to flirt with solvency issues because they have such strong, dependable cash flows.

### The Economic Consequences of Working Capital, the Current Ratio, and the Quick Ratio

- Investors, bankers and other lenders use these (and other) ratios to asses company's performance
  - For example, Dun & Bradstreet includes these ratios in their [14 key business ratios](https://www.mergent.com/solutions/research/key-business-ratios-(kbr)) to rate credit worthiness
  - Auditors often use low working capital as a red flag indicating fraud because it puts pressure on managers to fudge the numbers.
  - If these numbers (working capital and current ratio) are bad enough, they can indicate going concern issues.

- Maintaining certain levels in these ratios is often included in debt covenants
- Another ratio to assess a company's management of assets is sales/working capital

### Limitations of the Current Asset Classification

- These ratios give a snapshot of the company's solvency at a point in time, but more digging is required to predict future solvency.

- __window dressing__: exercising discretion to make the company's ratios look better
  - techniques include:
    - moving money into certain accounts
    - incorrectly recognizing revenue
    - changing accounting methods
    - doing certain operating activities
    - other fraud
  - window dressing can damage a company's reputation

#### A Movement toward Cash Flow Accounting

- People are moving from the income statement ratios discussed above to ratios using the statement of cash flows' operating, investing and financing activities.
  - The income statement ratios are still used because they're easy to calculate.

- As we discuss individual current asset accounts, remember they play a part in these ratios.

## Cash

- most companies include cash and cash equivalents in a single balance sheet account
  - Cash consists of: coin, currency, checking accounts, money orders, certified checks, cashier's checks, personal checks, and bank drafts received by a company.
  - cash equivalents: short term, highly liquid investments normally with maturities of 3 months or less.
    - Remember, cash is the basis for the measurement principle

- Issues related to cash that pertain to managers:
  - restrictions on the use of cash
  - proper management of cash
  - control of cash

### Restrictions on the Use of Cash

- Unless there are restrictions on the use of cash, cash is reported at face value.

- Examples of restrictions on the use of cash:
  - to ensure interest and principal payments are made, creditors sometimes require:
    - a cash balance be held in __escrow__ (by a third party trustee)
    - a minimum cash balance "__compensating balance__" be maintained by the company

- Restrictions on the use of cash should be disclosed to investors by:
  - separate balance sheet accounts for restricted cash
  - clear descriptions in the footnotes

- If restricted cash is to be unrestricted within the time period of current assets, you don't have to record it as restricted cash.

### Proper Management of Cash

- You need cash to recognize different opportunities, but too much cash is a lost opportunity.
- __petty cash__: small amounts of cash used to cover day-to-day needs
- Use extra cash to pay dividends or invest in income producing assets like short-term investments, inventories, long-term investments, property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets.
- Having a rainy day fund isn't bad, just don't over do it

### Control of Cash

- Controlling cash is an important function of an accounting department, especially in companies with frequent cash transactions.

#### Record Control of Cash

- __Record control__: the procedures designed to ensure cash recorded on the balance sheet is accurate. This involves:
  - faithful recording and posting of cash receipts and disbursements
  - Periodic reconciliations of balance sheet cash with actual cash you have.
    - Actual cash amount is usually provided by a bank statement

#### physical Control of Cash

- __Physical control__: procedures designed to safeguard cash from loss or theft.

- separation of duties is an important part of a well-controlled system.
  - Don't let employees who make cash transactions implement physical controls.

- Cash hould be handled by as few people as possible, so everyone who handles it is accountable
- Cash should be kept in a safe when not in use
- Part of these controls in ensuring you have enough petty cash available.

## Accounts Receivable

- __Accounts receivable__: short-term (30-60 day) extensions of credit
  - Usually in the form of goods or services
  - Usually arise from oral rather than written commitments because a written contract is overkill
  - aka __Open accounts__

- Companies don't usually collect interest on accounts receivable when they're paid withing 30-60 days, but often have high rates after that period

- When recording accounts receivable:
  - credit accounts receivable
  - debit other revenue accounts (usually sales or service revenue)

- Note, accounts receivable is *recognized*. This is an application of the accrual system of accounting.
  - 4 criteria for recognizing revenue (see ch3):
    1. earning process is substantially complete
    2. Revenue is objectively measurable
    3. post-sale costs can be estimated
    4. cash collection is reasonably assured
  - In GAAP, there's more rules surrounding this for individual industries, and different contract types.

- When cash is received form the receivable:
  - cash is credited
  - Accounts receivable is debited

- Accounts receivable is used by fraudsters because the documentation requirements are low.

### Importance of Accounts Receivable

- It's important for a company to take advantage of the revenues provided by accounts receivable.
  - Some industries, like car sales, rely on accounts receivable more than other.

- Note: when a customer uses a bank card to pay for an item or service (e.g., VISA or MasterCard), the selling company doesn't cary the receivable on its valance sheet. The receivable is "sold" to the finance company that issued the card. Such an arrangement is called *factoring*.

### Net Realizable Value: The Valuation Base for Accounts Receivable

- There's no point in recording the present value for accounts receivable beacuse they'll be collected so soon. Just record the actual amount of the sale (face value).

- Reasons why recording face value might not be accurate:
  - bad debts: when a customer refuses to pay
  - sales returns: when a customer returns an item
  - discounts: Some companies offer a discount if customers pay within a certain time period
  - rebates...

- __net realizable value__: an estimate of the cash that is expected to be produced by the receivables
  - __Net Realizable value of accounts receivable__ = Face Value - (Adjustments for (1)Bad debts, (2) Sales Returns, and (3) Cash Discounts)

- We'll cover these adjustments, except we won't cover cash discounts

### The Allowance Method of Accounting for Bad Debts (Uncollectibles)

- Methods to reduce bad debts:
  - assess customers credit worthiness before extending credit
    - use a credit rating service like Dun & Bradstreet, Moody's, or Standard & Poor
  - persue legal proceedings
  - require only cash sales

- All of the above methods come at a cost.
- Because not all accounts receivable can be reasonable assured (revenue recognition criteria), you have to adjust for bad debts.

- You have to record bad debts proactively and reactively
  - you record bad debts reactively when you find evidence you won't be able to collect a debt.
  - recording bad debts proactively means you record bad debts without evidence because you statistically expect some receivables to be uncollectable.

- To reduce bad debts you have to:
  - reduce the value of accounts receivable on the balance sheet
  - adjustment to reduce net income

- The __allowance method__ is uses the following 3 steps to record bad debts:
  1. The dollar amount of bad debts is estimated at the end of the accounting period
  2. an adjusting journal entry, which recognizes a bad debt expense on the income statement and reduces the net balance in accounts receivable, is recorded in the books
  3. a write-off journal entry is recorded when a bad debt actually occurs.

- The steps in the allowance method are discussed in more detail below

#### Step 1: Estimating Bad Debts

- The __percentage-of-credit-sales approach__ is the most common method for estimating bad debts. In this method a percent, based on past experience or competitors rates in the industry, is multiplied by accounts receivable to estimate bad debts.
  - later, we'll cover the aging method

- Managers often want low bad debt rate estimates, but auditors have to ensure they're using a conservative rate.
- Companies with larger receivables turnover usually have better estimates for these percentages.

#### Step 2: Adjusting Journal Entry

- journal entries for bad debts:
  1. reduce the assets on the *balance sheet* by recording an __Allowance for doubtful accounts__ credit against your Accounts receivable
      - Allowance for doubtful accounts is AKA Allowance, Allowance for Losses, or Reserve for Doubtful accounts
      - Allowance for doubtful accounts is a permanent contra asset account with a credit balance.
  2. reduce the net income on the *income statement* by recording one of the following against the revenue you recorded for your receivable:
      - recording a bad debt expense
      - if the "bad debts" should never have been expected to be collected, record a contra revenue. This essentially says the sale was never made.

#### Step 3: The Write-Off Journal Entry

- When a bad debt actually occurs, reduce both the allowance account (credit) and the accounts receivable (debit) balance on the balance sheet.
  - For example, when a borrower goes bankrupt or when a company determines persuing a debt is too costly, you'd record a bad debt.
  - example write-off policy: "*The company's policy is to write off accounts when the scheduled minimum payment has not been received for six consecutive months, or if any portion of the balance is more than 12 months past due, or if it is otherwise determined that the customer is unable to pay.*"

- Nothing happens on the income statement because you already reduced it in step 2.

- This write-off ultimately has no effect on the financial statements because it was already accounted for.
  - It has no net effect on accounts receivable balance, current assets, working capital, the current ratio, quick assets, or net income.
  - The current ratio, working capital, quick ratio and net income are all uneffected.

#### Bad Debt Recoveries

- If you recover a written-off bad debt, just reverse the write-off by:
  - First:
    - Debiting Accounts Receivable
    - Crediting Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
  - Then:
    - Crediting cash
    - Debiting Accounts Receivable

### Inaccurate Bad Debt Estimates

- At the end of a period, you record an amount of bad debt you expect over the course of the next period; if this bad debt estimate is wrong, you have a "preadjustment balance in allowance for doubtful accounts"

- preadjustment balances in allowance for doubtful accounts can result from:
  - *overestimated bad debts*, meaning you have a *credit balance* in allowance for doubtful accounts.
  - *underestimated bad debts*, meaning you have a *debit balance* in allowance for doubtful accounts.

- After adjusting, you'll have a 0 balance in allowance for doubtful accounts.

- preadjustment balances can be ignored if they're immaterial. Furthermore, preadjustment balances from one year often neutralize preadjustment balances from other years.
  - Material preadjustment balances must be adjusted
  - If preadjustment balances accumulate year over year, you have to adjust for them.

- Sometimes fraudulent companies intentionally misstate their preadjustment balances to report more or less cash than they actually have.
- Usually, preadjustment balances just mean you need to fix your bad debts allowance percentage formulas.
- Users of financial statements can detect preadjustment balances by comparing allowance accounts to sales and accounts receivable accounts across time.

#### An Aging Schedule: Another Method of Estimating Bad Debts

- A bad debt __aging schedule__ assigns bad debt rates to receivables based on how long it's been since they were granted.
  - The longer a receivable is outstanding, the less likely it is to be collected, and has a higher bad debt rate.

#### Aging as a Management Tool

- Collecting receivables quickly is important because the time value of money states that present value of money is > the future value of money

- The aging method provides the following information to managers:
  - Identifying and directing collection efforts to older accounts.
  - Determining how much money should be spent on a collection effort.
  - Determining future interest rates
  - Determining how much money you're loosing on certain receivables (puts it in a time-value perspective)
  - Weather a company should offer discounts on the receivable to speed up collection.
  - Weather the company should sell the debt to a debt collector.

- Establishing and maintaining the aging method can be difficult and costly.
  - They usually require computer models

### Accounting for Sales Returns

- When products that were exchanged for receivables are returned, the recognized receivables and revenues are either:
  - removed from the books
  - kept on the books and the customers are granted of future credit. (an exchange)

- To record returns:
  - adjust the income statement and accounts receivable on the balance sheet.
  - The methods used to account for sales returns are similar to those used to account for bad debts:
    - At the end of the period an estimate of returns is made.
    - Income is reduced on the income statement and allowances (a contra accounts receivable account) increased on the balance sheet by that estimate.
    - Returns are debited against the allowance and credited against the accounts receivable when they happen.

## Two Fundamental Issues Related to Receivables

- When accounting for short-term receivables, the following 2 questions must be answered:
  - When should a receivable be recorded in the books?
    - think the revenue recognition principle
  - At what dollar amount should a receivable be valued on the balance sheet?

### When Should a Receivable be Recorded?

- Different companies use different standards for when they recognize revenue.
- Recognizing revenue toward the end of the period can impact the financial statements for that period.

- Premature recognition of receivables and revenue is the primary method of fraud.
  - remember pressure on management is a major contributor to fraud.

### Balance Sheet Valuation of Receivables

- The correct value of receivables depends on your estimation of bad debts
  - it's difficult for outsiders to evaluate these estimates

- as a use of financial statements, remember:
  - bad debts can be significant
  - estimating bad debts is subjective
  - management is often unwilling to establish large bad debt provisions
    - which can result in fraud

- possible impacts of accounts receivable estimation methods:
  - credit rating impact
  - debt covenant violations
  - accelerated bankruptcy proceedings
  - lawsuits against managers and auditors
  - techniques like: "taking a bath", "hidden reserves"...
    - These techniques can be fraudulent

#### Financial Institutions and Uncollectible Loans

- Uncollectible Receivables can cause companies to fail. If these companies are major banks, they can cause the economy to fail. Because of this, the FASB rules banks must have higher bad debt rates and must disclose the market values of their outstanding loans.
