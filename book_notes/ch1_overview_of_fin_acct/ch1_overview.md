## Financial Reporting and Investment Decisions

- 4 financial statements:
  - balance sheet
  - income statement
  - statement of shareholders' equity
  - statement of cash flows

- The following parties use financial reports to make investment decisions:
  - **Profit-seeking companies** use financial reports
  - ***Owners and other interested parties (users)** use financial reports
    - users include: investors, bankers, government agencies, employees, customers, and suppliers

- Financial reports, economic consequences and user decisions are a feedback loop. They all each affect each other.

## Economic Consequences

- __Economic consequence perspective__: the economic consequences of actions that affect financial statements.
  - for example, using assets could mean higher interest rates because loans to you are more risky

## User Orientation

-  __user orientation__: providing users with the right statements and the ability to use them to make informed decisions

## The Demand for Financial Information: A user's Orientation

- funds can be consumed or invested

### Consumption and Investment

- Consumption expenditures are enjoyed immediately and have no future value
-  Investment expenditures generate returns of additional money at later dates.

### Where to Invest?

- This section describes how to decide if a company is worth investing in

#### The Demand for Documentation

- get the financial statements discribed above to snsure a company is in good standing.

### The Demand for an Independent Audit

- The __independent audit__ process consists of a __certified public accountant (CPA)__ reviewing a company's financial statements.
- don't invest in companies without an independent auditor checking for fraud.

### Martin and the CPA: Different Incentives

- auditors must be independent, not influenced by the company hiring them, so they don't ignore fraud.

- The company MUST provide the following information

## The Auditor's Report, the Management Letter, and the Financial Statements.

- Important information:
  - __audotor's report__: a short letter written by the audotor that describes the activities of the audit and comments on the financial position and operations of the company.
  - __management letter__: a letter, signed by the CEO, taking responsibility for the figures on the statements
  - a balance sheet
  - an income statement
  - a statement of shareholders' equity
  - a statement of cashflows
  - footnotes

### The Auditor's Report

- The report should say:
  - statements follow GAAP
  - The statements are accurate
  - The statements are honest (the company has followed internal controls)

- Concerns that make it to the auditor's report are important. Don't ignore them. If the report says "there are significant estimates", listen!

### The Mnagement Letter

- The management letter is a statement from the manager saying that there is no fraud. It usually includes statements about:
  - the __internal control system__
  - GAAP
  - ethics
  - policies and procedures
  - the board or directors and the audit committee

### The Financial Statements

- financial statements report past performance.
- Watch out for estimates.

- each financial statement has a different purpose:
  - the balance sheet lists a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity
  - The income statement reports net income (revenu - expenses)
  - The statement of shareholders' equity includes:
      - The beginning and ending common stock and retained earnings balance (from the balance sheet)
      - net income, the bottom line on the income statement
      - dividends

### The Footnotes

- The footnotes will further explain issues in statements, the auditor's report or the management letter.

## Descriptions of Financial statements

- Definitions:
  - __Balance sheet__: lists assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. It is a statement of the company's current financial condition.
    - __Assets__: items that will bring future economic benefit. Includes: cash, accounts receivable, and the cost of things bought (land, equipment...)
    - __Liabilities__: amounts owed to __creditors__ generally requiring future cash payments
    - __Shareholders' equity__: comprised of retained earnings and common stock.
      - __Retained earnings__: the amount of money earned and re-invested in a business.
      - __Common stock__: the initial investment of a company's owners.
    - quiz1 definition of balance sheet: This financial statement is structured as assets equals liabilities plus ownersâ€™ equity, and it measures the financial condition of a company at a specific point in time.
  - __Income statement__: shows the revenues and expenses and the resulting net income.
    - __Revenues__: assets generated from sales and services
    - __Expenses__: asset outflows (costs) associated with selling products and servies.
    - __Net income__ = revenue - expenses
      - aka profit or earnings
      - High income is the ultimate goal.
  - __Statement of shareholders' equity__: describes changes in shareholders equity.
    - aka statement of owners' equity
    - quiz 1 defines as: This financial statement explains the changes in the investments made by the owners from the beginning to the end of a specific period of time and includes changes in both the direct investments made by the owners and the profits allowed to remain in the company.
    - __Dividends__: assets paid to owners as a return for initial investment. These are subtracted from retained earnings on the balance sheet.
  - __Statement of cash flows__: summarizes the increases and decreases in cash over a period of time. (like a balance sheet, but just cash). Activities that affect this can be Operating, investing or financing. Gives insight into management strategies.
    - __Operating activities__: activities associated with products and services
    - __Investing activities__: purchase and sale of assets (like land or equipment).
    - __Financing activities__: cash collections and payments related to capital sources.
      - think lending or borrowing, collections or payments.

## Analysis of Financial Statements

- __Solvency__: The ability to generate enough cash to pay off debts.
- __Earning power__: the ability to grow and provide a substantial return to owners.

- Ratios:
  - (net income/revenues) tells how much of the revenue turns into profit.
  - (liabilities/ assets) tells if the company has enough assets to pay off their debts.
  - (dividends/ net income) tells how much investors get from investing in the company.

## Which Form of Investment: Debt or Equity?

- Debt investment: loans
- Equity investment: becoming an owner
- They come with different risks and returns. Also different levels of attention you should pay.

### A Debt Investment

- __debt investments__: investing by loaning money
  - requires a __loan contract__ stating:
    - the **maturity date** when the loan must be paid back
    - the **annual interest** to be paid each year
    - the **collateral** assets you will acquire if the person you lend to **defaults** on the loan (doesn't pay it back)
    - **debt restrictions** placed on the borrower requiring them to do certain things to protect your investment.

- Before making a debt investment check if:
  - The company's statement of cash flows. Cash is how you will be repayed.
  - The value of the collateral is fair.
    - Remember, assets are recorded on the balance sheet at __historical cost__, the amount paid when they were acquired. This is often not a fair estimate of their current value and shouldn't be used for collateral purposes.
  - The company has other debts.

### An Equity Investment

- __equity investments__ entail purchasing __equity__ in a company and becoming a __shareholder__

- Often shareholders care most about dividends, which are paid on the order of the board of directors.
  - __Board of directors__: a group of people elected by shareholders to represent their interests.
    - meets quarterly to: set company policies, declare dividends, and review performance and compensation of the company's upper management (who they can fire/hire).

- Before making an equity investments check if:
  - The company can make money and will make money in the future
    - Make sure they have cash (statement of cash flows)
    - Make sure they pay debts (balance sheet)
    - make sure their investments are sound ()
    - The income statement tells if they're making money. This can also tell you if the management is competent.
  - The company has dividends (statement of cash flows).
  - The board is good at managing the company

## A Decision is made, but Important Questions Remain

- Review:
  - Solvency, earnings power, return on investment.
  - audit report, management letter, financial statements and footnotes.
  - dividends, payments to creditors.

# The Economic Environment in which Financial Reports are Prepared and Used

- Accurate financial statements inform economic decisions and prevent economic crisis.
- __compensation contracts__: how much you're going to pay someone and what they're going to do.

- roles of financial accounting:
  - help debt and equity investors evaluate management's past business decisions and predict future performance
  - present numbers (e.g., net income) used in debt and compensation contracts that influence management behavior.

- __corporate governance__: the mechanisms encouraging management and auditors to act in the interest of- and report in god faith to- the shareholders.

- factors that encourage managers and auditors to act professionally:
  - __professional reputation__: leads to future business
  - __legal liability__: penalizes bad behavior
  - __ethics__: doing the right thing.

- This section discusses the the reporting process and corporate governance.

## Reporting Entities and Industries

- __profit-seaking entities__ companies not seaking profit prepare financial statements.
  - we only cover for-profit companies

- __subsidiaries__ of a company provide their own financial statements which are combined into __consolidated financial statements__ by their parent company.

- Companies are often grouped into __industries__ based on the nature of their operations.
  - 3 basic categories of industry: manufacturing, retailing, services and (general and financial).
  - industry classifications are provided by the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Index, which assigns a 1 to 4 digit code to each industry. The more digits in the code, the more specific the industry.
  - Different parts of the balance sheet are important in different industries.
    - for example, liabilities are important for banks.
  - Industry standards can be used as a benchmark.

# Corporate Governance

- corporate governance mechanisms ensure management acts in the shareholder's interest and report to them in good faith.

- components of corporate governanace:
  - financial information users and capital markets
  - contracts between management and debt and equity investors
  - financial reporting regulations and standards
  - independent auditors
  - boards of directors and audit committees
  - internal controls ensuring compliance
  - legal liability
  - professional reputation
  - ethics

- corporate governance and financial statements are symbiotic.

## Financial Information Users and Capital Markets

- Users of financial statements can be divided into 3 groups:
  - equity investors
  - debt investors
  - others (including management)

### Equity Investors

- Equity investors have 2 rights:
  - oversee management
    - usually reserved for investors who own a large portion of the company.
  - a fair share of profit

- Equity investors (and their representatives) use financial information to evaluate management's decisions.

### Debt Investors (Creditors)

- See the section "A Debt Investment" for what a loan is.
- The debt contract is pretty much the only way creditors can influence a company.
- Creditors use financial statements to estimate the likelihood of default.
  - If the chances of default go up, the need for collateral increases, interest rates become steeper and terms of the debt contract become harsher.

### Management and Other Financial Statement Users

- Management uses financial statements of:
  - competitors to assess their strategy
  - potential partners (suppliers, customers...) to assess their trustworthiness
  - themselves to determine dividend payments, set company policies, and guide business decisions.

- other users:
  - government (FTC) for determining regulations.
  - public utilities for determining rates
  - labor uninos for determining fair wages and other benefits.

### Capital Markets

- __equity securities__ are stocks

- __debt securities__
  - __bonds__ can be owned by individuals and institutions
  - loans are usually held by banks

- security prices (market price) are determined by changes in expectations.
  - these expectations are often set by financial statements

- prices of securities are sometimes considered a measure of management's performance, but can be determined by other factors too.

## Contracts: Debt Covenants and management Compensation

- Debt restriction (see "A Debt investment") contracts take 2 forms:
  - __Debt covenants__: 
    - included in debt contracts
    - Often requires management maintain a certain level of financial performance or position to help ensure management is able to repay debts. Violating these requirements (technical default) normally gives the debtholder the right to demand the entire debt be repaid immediately, often leading to more costly debt terms.
  - __Management compensation contracts__:
    - require management pay be based on certain net income or stock price goals, to incentivise management's actions toward a clear goal.

- The debt restrictions discussed rely heavily on financial statements.

## Independent Auditors

- Usually firms hire from "the Big 4" accounting firms when performing audits.

- Audits result in a 3 paragraph audit report (aka audit opinion) stating:
  1. paragraph 1: Financial statements and internal controls were audited, but responsibility for preparing financial reports and the effectiveness of the controls rests with management
  2. Paragraph 2: the audit complies with __Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)__ standards.
  3. Paragraph 3: financial statements complie with GAAP

- If the audit report doesn't say the above, there are problems.

## Board of Directors and Audit Committee

- see "An Equity Investment" for what a Board of Directors does.
  - The board is usually composed of company officers and nonmanagement representatives.

- __audit committee__: an outside (nonmanagement) subcommittee that handles audits.
  - Appointed by the board.
  - works with management to choose an auditor
  - monitors audits to ensure thorough, objective and independent audits.s

- "opinion shopping" for auditors is prohibited by the SEC.
  - If a company disagrees with the auditor, they can state why on the Form 8K. They shouldn't find a different auditor who will say what they want.

## Sarbanes-Oxley Act

- __Sarbanes-Oxley Act__: an act to enforce stricter corporate governance and restore confidence in the U.S financial reporting system.
  - passed in 2002
  - changes were made to: the responsibilities of management, financial disclosure, independence and effectiveness of auditors and audit committeees, and oversight of public companies and auditors.
  - new responsibilities
    - management must review and sign off on financial reports certifying their completeness, correctness, and fairness.
    - more internal controls to ensure complete and accurate financial records.
    - management must file a report on internal controls, which must be certified by an external auditor

## Legal Liability

- legal responsibilities:
  - management must act on behalf of shareholders and report in good faith
  - Auditors must conduct a thorough and independent audit.

- If management or auditors fail these legal responsibilites, they can be sued.
  - think Laventhol & Horwath or Arthur Andersen

## Professional Reputation and Ethics

- Ethics is an asset!
- In the long run, ethics is in the best interest of managers, shareholders and auditors.
- Ethical companies and auditors are sued less and valued more.

## Financial Reporting Regulations and Standards

- __Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)__ created to enforce:
  - the Securities Act of 1933 requiring companies that raise capital through public equity and debt exchanges to file a registration statement with the SEC
  - the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requiring public companies file:
    - a __Form 10-k__ (audited financial reports annually)
    - a __Form 10-Q__ (unaudited quarterly financial statements)
    - provide audited financial statements to stake holders
    - Non-U.S companies must file a __Form 20-F__
    You can find these through the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system at www.sec.gov.

- __annual reports__, include:
  - audited balance sheets for the past 2 years
  - audited income, shareholders equity and cashflows for the past 3 years.
  - A letter to shareholders
  - a description of the business
  - discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and performance
  - footnotes
  - selected quarterly data
  - Summaries of select information for the last 5 years
  - information about each of the company's major segments
  - A letter from management stating its reporting responsibilities
  - A letter from the company's outside (external) auditors stating financial statements were prepared according to GAAP
  - A list of board members and executive officers

## Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

- The SEC requires U.S. GAAP

- __U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP)__ for U.S. companies.
  - Established by the __Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)__

- __International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)__ for non-U.S. companines
  - Established by the __International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)__

- This book uses GAAP to refer to U.S GAAP or IFRS.
- GAAP lends credibility to financial statements. 
- Some argue the costs of accounting standards out-weigh the benefits.
  - The principles often become political.
