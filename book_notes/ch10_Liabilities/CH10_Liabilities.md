# Ch 10 Intro to Liabilities: Economic Consequences, Current Liabilities, and Contingencies

- __Liability__: obligations to disburse assets or provide services in the future
  - current liabilities
    - ex: short-term payables
  - Long-term liabilities
    - ex: long-term notes, bonds, leases, retirement costs (appendix A), and deferred income taxes (appendix B)

- contingent liabilities can be short or long term.
- Liabilities can be difficult to measure especially when companies have latitude in setting reserves (liabilities) for future costs.
- CH 11 covers using the *effective interest method* to account for long-term notes, bonds and leases.

## What Is a Liability?

- 3 characteristics of a liability:
  1. They require payments of goods or services in the future
  2. These payments are unavoidable
  3. The obligations to make these payments must have already been entered into.

- Examples of liabilities: credit balances with suppliers, debts from borrowings, services yet to be performed, witholdings from employees' wages and salaries, dividened declarations, product warranties, deferred income taxes, and certain financing arrangements.

- Later we'll discuss economic liabilities vs balance sheet liabilities

## The Relative Size of Liabilities on the Balance Sheet

- __debt ratio__ = liabilities / assets

- the size of the debt ratio varies by industry (higher means more debt per assets):
  - banks are high
  - car manufacturers are high
  - companies with large amounts of property, plant and equipment are high
  - Internet firms are generally low

## Reporting Liabilities on the Balance Sheet: Economic Consequences

- Many ratios used by financial statement users include debt as a figure.
  - For example, seven of Dun & Bradstreet's 14 key business ratios are:
    1. quick ratio = ([cash + marketable securities + receivables] / current liabilities)
    2. current ratio = (current assets / current liabilities)
    3. current liabilities / net worth
    4. current liabilities / inventory
    5. total liabilities / net worth
    6. sales / net working capital
    7. accounts payable / sales
  - These ratios are used to: determine credit ratings, assess solvency and future cash flows, predict bankruptcy, and assess financial health.

### Shareholders and Investors

- __leverage__: using debt to generate revenue
  - attracts shareholders because they don't have to invest to get returns.
  - interest is tax deductible
  - this strategy is risky

- Creditors take precidence over investors
  - If interest isn't paid, companies can't distribute dividends.
  - On liquidity, creditors are paid first.

### Creditors

- __Creditor__: a person or company to whom money is owed

- debt covenants are conditions creditors include on loans.
  - for example: collateral, restricting future borrowing, restricting more stock issuing, restricting selling assets, restricting mergers or requiring certain ratios be maintained.

### Management

- Pros of debt:
  - provides cash for OIF activities

- cons of debt:
  - puts demands on your cash
  - negatively affects credit rating
  - negatively affects financial ratios
    - managers care about this (incentives)!
    - companies use this to "take a bath" in bad years or build "hidden reserves" in good years
  - covenants

### Auditors

- Auditors are responsible for verifying that all liabilities are identified and reported.

## Current Liabilities

- __Current liabilities__: obligations expected to require use of current assets or the creation of other current liabilities.
  - obligations due within a year may not be current if:
    1. they're expected to be paid from non-current assets
    2. They're expected to be refinanced with long-term liabilities or equity issuances.
  
- ex: obligations to suppliers, short term debts, current maturites on long-term debts, dividends payable to shareholders, deferred revenues (services or goods yet to be performed that use a current asset), third-party collections (e.g., sales tax and payroll deductions), periodic accurals (e.g., wages and interest

### The Relative size of Current Liabilities on the Balance sheet

- *Current liabilities / Total liabilities* tells how much you're financing with current vs total liabilities
- internet companies and banks often have relatively high current liabilities, where oil companies have relativley low current liabilites (plant, prop and equipment loans are long term).

### Valuing Current liabilities on the Balance Sheet

- The difference between __face value__ and __present value__ of current liabilities is often assumed immaterial, and the current liability is simply reported at face value
  - __face value__: The cash payment due to fulfill the liability
  - __present value__: the discounted future cash payment to fulfill the liability

### Reporting Current Liabilities: An Economic Consequence

- Accurate reporting of *all* current liabilities is especially important because current liabilities are used in a lot of ratios

## Determinable Current liabilities
