# CH3 The Measurement Fundamentals of Financial Accounting

- FASB recently changed how revenue is recognized:
  - old way: revenues from products that require continuing services, were recorded against the continuing services
    - ex: Apple's revenut from iPhones would have to be recorded against OS updates (spread over time, usually 2 years)
  - new way: revenues from products that require continuing services, are recorded earlier.

- when revenue is recognized and other __assumptions, principles, and exceptions__ can make financial statements look very different.

## Assumptions of Financial Accounting

- 4 accounting assumptions:
  - economic entity
  - fiscal period
  - going concern
  - stable dollar

- Be aware when these assumptions aren't met

### Economic Entity Assumptions

- __economic entity assumption__: a company is a distinct profit-seeking entity.
  - "distinct" means Company and employee finances don't mix.
    - When a company has subsidiaries, they company and the subsidiary can be considered distinct or not distinct, depending on the situation.
  - "profit-seaking" means money measures company's performance.

### Fiscal Period Assumption

- __financial period assumption__: The operating life of an entity is divided into time periods
- Periodic reports allow stakeholders to monitor and control performance

#### Timely vs. Objective Financial Information

- Reports from short time periods (ex quarterly reports) are un-audited, meaning they are less objective.
- It makes since that companies can't constantly produce high-quality reports because they're expensive

#### A calendar year or Fiscal Year

- __Fiscal year__: a single fiscal period.
  - usually corresponds with the calendar year but not always.
    - for example, retailers are busy during the holidays so they shift their calendar accordingly

### Going Concern Assumption

- __Going concern assumption__: the entity must continue existing for us to keep reporting on it
- this is also relevant to assets that produce revenue over a long lifespan
- Auditors issue "going concern" oppinions to companies that might failv

### Stable Dollar Assumption

- __Stable dollar assumption__: the dollar must be stable so we have something stable to measure profit against

#### Inflation: The Dollar's Changing Purchasing Power

- __purchasing power__: how much a dollar can buy
  - changes from inflation
  - Refers to the overall market value of a dollar, not the dollar against the price of a particular good or service.

#### A Limitation in the Financial Statements

- IFRS deals with inflation because some of international countries face significant inflation.
- In America, inflation is only dealt with if it's material because otherwise adjusting for it ultimately retracts information.

### Summary of Basic Assumptions

- Valuations on the balance sheet and the principles of financial accounting measurement inter-relate to these assumptions.

## Valuations on the Balance Sheet

- Assets purchased from __input markets__ are transformed by __entity operations__ and are sold on __output markets__ usually for a higher price.
- assets can be valued at the input market value or output market value depending on the context.

### four valuation bases

- __Valuation bases__ are used to determine the dollar amounts attached to the accounts on a balance sheet. They are:
  - __Present value__: the discounted future cash flows associated with a particular financial statement item
    - see appendix A for computing present value
    - For example: The present value of a note receivable is calculated by determining the amount and timing of its future cash inflows and adjusting the dollar amounts for the time value of money.
    - This is often used for long-term assets
  - __Fair market value__: the current value of the item on the output market.
    - aka sales price
  - __Replacement cost__: The current value of the item on the input market.
    - how much it would cost to replace the item.
  - __original cost__: The price paid for the item when it was bought.
    - aka historical cost

### Valuation Bases Used on the Balance Sheet

- account types and which valuation base to use to evaluate them
  - current assets/liabilities
    - Recorded at present value, because they will materialize soon.
    - present value == __face value__
  - Inventories
    - Recorded at __lower-of-cost-or-market rule__ to be conservative.
      - lower-of-cost-or-market = min(replacement cost, original cost)
  - Long-term investments
    - Long-term investments include land, securities etc.
    - Usually recorded at original cost unadjusted for amortized or depreciated
      - Note: sometimes long-term investments use the equity method, which is a periodically adjusted original cost, discussed in chapter 8.
  - Pre-paid expenses, plant and equipment and intangible assets
    - recorded at min(*net book value*, present value)
      - *net book value* = original cost - amortization (or depreciation)
  - Long-term notes receivable and long-term liabilities
    - recorded at presetn value
  - Shareholders' equity
    - Technically not valued on these valuation bases.
    - Can be understood as how much the company is worth (assets - liabilities)

## The principles of Financial Accounting Measurement

- these principles explain why different valuation methods are used.

- 4 basic principles of financial accounting measurement:
  - objectivity
  - matching
  - revenue recognition
  - consistency

### The Principle of Objectivity

- The __objectivity__ principle requires financial accounting information be verifiable (with evidence) and reliable.
  - This can prevent companies from reporting important information that's not objective

- Objectivity is sometimes tricky to follow. For example, when evaluating the present value of an asset, you must estimate how much revenue the asset will generate in the future. For some assets (like bonds) future revenues are easy to calculate objectively, but for many assets (like patients, equipment...) objectively calculating a present value is difficult.
  - You can also calculate the present value of a liability.

#### Present Value and the Financial Statements

- Only report using present value when calculating it objectively is straight forward (like bonds).
  - In the book, they reported the present value of a loan a company granted. The loan had a contract, so reporting the contract's present value was an *arm's-length transaction*.

#### Market Value and the Financial Statements

- Fair market value is more objective than present value because it relies on the market to determine how much an asset is worth, instead of calculating an arbitrary present value.

- Unfortunately, fair market value is often not objective enough to use in financial statements.
  - For example: securities not traded on major stock exchanges, inventories, long-term investments, property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets can't be objectively evaluated with fair market value and must be evaluated with *original cost* (often adjusted for depreciation or amortization).
  - Some assets can be evaluated objectively with fair market value like short-term investments.

- IFRS doesn't stress objectivity as much

#### Original Cost and the Financial Statements

- __original cost__: the price paid for an asset
  - keep your receipts to objectively back-up this up.

- __net book value__ = original cost - (amoritization or depreciation)
- the following are reported at original cost or net book value: prepaid expenses, land, securities, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets.
