# Ch 4 The Mechanics of Financial Accounting

- This chapter discusses the mechanics of preparing financial statements to report transactions accurately, timely and completely.
- This chapter also discusses reading financial statements using T-account analysis

## Economic Events

- Financial statements must only report relevant and objectively measurable __Economic events__.

### Relevant Events

- __Relevant event__: an economic event large enough to affect a company's financial condition
  - ex: elections, wars, changing CEOs...

### Objectivity

- The normal standard for __objectivity__ is when parties with conflicting objectives can agree on the truth
  - for example, when buyers (who want a low price) and sellers (who want a high price) agree on an objective price
  - objectivity also requires documentation

- If you can't honestly be objective, be conservative

## The Fundamental Accounting Equation

```Accounting
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity
```

- All financial statements are based on the fundamental Accounting equation, but the balance sheet explicitly states how everything relates to it.
- The accounting must always balance, but even if it does, there might be accounting errors.

### Assets

- __Assets__: Items and rights obtained through objectively measurable transactions that can be used to generate revenue in the future
  - Assets are exchanged for other assets (usually cash or payables)
  - ex: cash, securities, receivables, land, buildings, machinery, equipment, and rights

- sources of assets:
  - borrow (liabilities)
  - owner contributions (Shareholders' Equity)
  - operating activities (asset exchanges)

### Liabilities

- __Liabilities__: obligations made on assets
  - ex: debts and payables

### Shareholders' Equity

- 2 Components of __shareholders equity__
  1. __contributed capital__: the dollar value of assets contributed by shareholders
  2. __Retained earnings__: the dollar value of assets generated by operating activities and retained in the business (not paid in dividends)
    - Operating activities are transactions directly associated with the acquisition and sale of a company's products or services.

``` Accounting
Assets = Liabilities + (Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings)
```

## Business Transactions, the Accounting Equation, and the Financial Statements

- __Business transactions__: the economic events of exchanging assets and liabilities.
- all business transactions can change the accounting equation, but it will always balance

### Transactions and the Accounting Equation

- This gives some examples of how different transactions affect the accounting equation

### The Accounting Equation and the Financial Statements

- Here they:
  - define "account"
  - prepare simplified balance sheets, statements of cash flows, income statement and statements of shareholders' equity

#### Accounts and the Accounting Equation

- Accounts subdivide the categories of the accounting equation
  - for example assets could have the accounts cash, receivables, land...

- Of a company's account, only a handful of the most informative accounts will appear on financial statements.
  - Financial statements should provide meaning to but not overwhelm users.

- US GAAP and IFRS use the same accounting equation

#### The Balance Sheet

- The balance sheet states the accounting equation as of a particular date.
  - It's named a "balance sheet" because the equation must balance

- Balance sheets include the accounts associated with each part of the accounting equation.

#### Statement of Cash Flows

- The statement of cash flows is only concerned with the cash account in the assets portion of the accounting equation (and balance sheet)

- The statement of cash flows divides this cash account into 3 sections:
  1. Operating
  2. Investing
  3. Financing

#### Income Statement

- The income statement measures assets generated from operating activities over a period of time.
  - *revenues*: asset inflows due to operating activities
  - *expenses*: asset outflows required to generate the revenues
  - *net income* (or *net loss*) = revenues - expenses

- Operating activities convert assets into the retained earnings account of the shareholders' equity section, hence the equation stays equal.
  - The retained earnings section includes these accounts: revenue accounts, expense accounts, and dividend accounts.
    - expenses and dividends decrease retained earnings; revenues increase retained earnings.

#### Statement of Shareholders' Equity

- The Statement of Shareholders' Equity just analyzes how the shareholders' equity part of the accounting equation has changed.
  - Example accounts in shareholders' equity: contributed capital, retained earnings
  - dividends affect shareholder's equity?

## The Journal Entry

- __Journal entries__: A short-hand way to represent which accounts are affected by a transaction and how they are affected.
  - __debit__: increases to the left side of the accounting equation, or decreases to the right side. (&uarr;&larr; || &darr;&rarr;)
    - on the left side of a journal entry
  - __credit__: increases to the right side of the accounting equation, or decreases to the left side. (&darr;&larr; || &uarr;&rarr;)
    - on the right side of a journal entry

- __Compound journal entries__ involve more than 2 accounts

### The Double Entry System

- The __double entry system__ maintains the equality of the accounting equation by ensuring `journal entry debits == journal entry credits.`
  - conceptually, the double entry system means a transaction is an exchange from one account to another

### The Journal Entry Box

- They have a memory thing here. Just remember:
  - (&uarr;&larr; || &darr;&rarr;)?debit:credit;

- components of a transaction:
  - the accounts affected
  - the amount of the affect
    - if it's positive or negative

### Journal Entries and the Accounting Equation: Examples

- figure 4-8 has some examples.
- just remember, the accounting equation is always maintained.

### T-Accounts

- __T-accounts__ are like journal entries but for only 1 account.
  - these obviously don't have to balance; but like journal entries debits go on the left, credits on the right.
