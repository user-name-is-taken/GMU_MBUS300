# CH5 Using Financial Statement Information

- every period, analysts make predictions on what a company's earnings will be. People often use these predictions, and if a company lived up to the predictions, when deciding to purchase a stock.
- This chapter describes how these predictions are made using financial statements.

- These financial statement information can be used to:
  - evaluate performance and predict future earnings and cash flows (dividends and interest)
  - influence and monitor management by associating it with financial incentives or debt covenants.
  - determine how much to charge a company for a service.
  - negotiate wages  (by unions)
  - determine interest rates (credit ratings)

## Control and Prediction

- 2 main uses of financial statement:
  - monitor and influence a company
  - predict a company's future earning and cash flows

### Financial Accounting Numbers and Management Control

- Investors and creditors often require management's compensation be based on financial numbers.
  - Some of these numbers include:
    - maximizing dividends, or stock price
    - maximize earnings power and long-term profitibility by basing compensation on reported profit.
  - compensation can be stock or cash.

- Often creditors place restrictions on a company based on financial statements:
  - requiring a company maintain a certain current ratio (current assets/current liabilities)
  - requiring a company maintain a minimum working capital (current assets - current liabilities)
  - There are often restrictions by creditors on how you can spend money (grant dividends, grant liens, incur or guarantee debt, lease equipment, etc.)

### Financial Accounting Numbers as Prediction Aids

- Financial numbers show a company's past performance. These can give an estimate of a company's business model and the company's future earnings and cash flows.

## Four Elements of Successful companies:

### Leverage

- capital structure: how a company is financed (capital/debt)

- __Leverage__: using debt to generate returns for shareholders.
  - leverage can increase risk if poorly managed
  - debt often comes with covenants.

### Solvency

- __Solvency__: the ability to pay debts.
  - current debt < current assets

### Asset Quality

- __Asset quality__: The extent to which assets generate revenue.
  - links assets to revenues

### Expense Control

- lower expenses are better

### Results

- You want return on assets and return on equity. Solvency, leverage, asset quality and expense control help achieve good returns!

## Analyzing the Financial Statements

- Financial figures are compaired:
  - across time
  - across different companies with the same industry
  - withing the financial statements of the company at a given point in time

### Comparisons across time

- GAAP requires financial statements list current and previous years side-by-side.
  - income statements, statements of cash flow, and statements of shareholders' equity are required for 3 years
  - balance sheets are required for 2 years.

- Companies often voluntarily give information for longer time-frames.

### Comparison within the Industry

- Companies are often compared to competitors in the same industry.
- Financial statements will look different from one industry to the next; but should look similar between inidustries.

### Comparisons within the Financial Statements: Common-Size Statements and Ratio Analysis

- there are 2 ways to compare numbers within the statement:
  - common-state financial statements
  - ratio analysis

#### Common-Size Financial Statements

- __common-size financial statements__ express financial figures as a percentage of other other financial figures *on the same statement*.
  - net income as a % of net sales
  - assets and liabilities as a % of total assets (or liabilities + shareholders' equity)
  - expenses as a % of sales
  - short term vs long-term liabilities

##### Financial Ratios

- __Ration analysis__ xpress financial figures as a percentage of other other financial figures *within statements*.

- often, ratio analysis compairs numbers on the balance sheet to numbers on the income statement.
  - Because the balance sheet shows numbers over time, this often entails averaging numbers on the balance sheet. This is done by summing the start and end balance and dividing by 2.

- Ratios are often used to asses a company's leverage, solvency, asset quality, and expense control.

##### Leverage Ratios

- some well-known leverage ratios are:
  - __Capital Structure Leverage__ = Average Total Assets / Average Shareholders' Equity
    - This measures how leveraged a company's assets are.
  - __Debt/equity ratio__ = Average Total Liabilities/Average Shareholder's Equity
    - Measures how leveraged a company's shareholder's investments are.
    - this is similar to Capital Structure Leverage
  - __Common Equity Leverage__ = Net Income/{Net Income + [Interest Expense (1 - Tax Rate)]}
    - Dividends on common stock are normally subtracted from net income in the numerator
    - This compares the Net Income to the Interest Expense to determine how effective a company is at using borrowed funds
  - __Long-Term Debt Ratio__ = Long-Term Liabilities/Total Assets
    - This tests if the company will be leveraged over the long-term
  
##### Solvency Ratios

- Leveraged companies must be solvent.

- Solvency ratios:
  - __current ratio__ = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
    - When this is < 1, a company has solvency issues
  - __quick ratio__ = (Cash + Short-Term Investments + Net Accounts Receivalbe) / Current Liabilities
    - Like the current ratio, but it excludes current assets like inventories or prepaid expenses that are not easily converted to cash
  - __Interest Coverage__ = (Net Income + Tax Expense + Interest Expense) / Interest Expense
    - Tax Expense and Interest Expense are added to Net Income to calculate Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT).
    - EBIT is used because it's the total amount of money that can cover interest.
    - Higher interest coverage = more solvent
  - __Accounts Payable Turnover__ = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Accounts Payable
    - The number of times accounts payable is paid off.
      - Avg. number of days of turnover = 365 / Accounts payable turnover
    - Companies with long Accounts Payable Turnovers:
      - may be having trouble paying back suppliers and are hence less solvent.
      - may be in a strong negotiating position with suppliers, so they can take a long time to pay them.
    - Companies with low Accounts Payable Turnovers:
      - May be in a bad negotiation position
      - may in a strong financial position, so paying off suppliers isn't a problem
      - could probably lengthen them as a way of leveraging/financing the company.

##### Asset Quality Ratios

- Asset quality ratios measure how fast assets move through operations.
  - These ratios are usually computed for: total assets, accounts receivable, inventory, and property, plant and equipment
  - remember, operations includes: acquisition, use (conversion to more revenue), then replacement
  - Faster is usually better.
  - Like Accounts Payable Turnover, you can convert these ratios into days by dividing 365 by them.

- Asset quality ratios:
  - __Asset Turnover__ = Sales / Average Total Assets
    - The number of times Assets are converted to revenues during the period.
    - higher is better
  - __Receivables Turnover__ = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
    - The number of times receivables were granted and collected during the period.
    - This can indicate how effective the company's credit granting policies are.
      - Higher turnover means more effective policies, but high turnover with low average accounts receivable sales can mean you rejected some credit sales you could have made.
  - __Inventory Turnover__ = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
    - how many times inventory turns over per period.
    - Higher inventory turnover means you hold less inventory, lower turnover means you hold more.
      - Having too much inventory incurs costs, but not enough can mean lost sales.
  - __Long-term Asset Turnover__ = Sales/Average Property, Plant and Equipment
    - measures the amount of long-term assets required to produce sales.
    - Higher ratios mean you don't need a lot of fixed assets to make sales.

##### Expense Control Ratios

- __Return on Sales, or Profit Margin__ = {Net Income + [Interest Expense (1 - Tax Rate)]} / Net Sales
  - After-tax Interest expense is added back to Net Income (after it was subtracted out to produce Net Income) because it's not an operating expense. These non-operating expenses generally don't grow when a company's sales grow.
  - The Idea here is to compare revenue to profit. If most of a company's revenue is converted to profit, the company has good expense control.

##### Overall Performance Measures

- Profitability is the primary measure of performance. Here are some profitability ratios:
  - __Return on Equity__ = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity
    - Average shareholders' equity = contributed capital + retained earnings
    - This measures how much profit investors get for their investments
  - __Return on Assets__ = {Net Income + [Interest Expense (1 - Tax Rate)]} / Average Total Assets
    - This formula measures the return to shareholders (Net Income) and creditors (interest) based on their investments (Assets).
      - Assets = Liabilities + Net Income
        - This is the fundamental accounting equation. This ratio relates every part of the fundamental accounting equation.

##### Other Ratios

- Other financial ratios:
  - __Earnings per Share__ = Net Income / Average Number of Commmon Shares Outstanding
    - GAAP requires this be on the face of the income statement.
    - Above is a basic formula, but it gets more complicated
    - Note, this doesn't tell how much money is actually invested. Shares could be worth $100000 each
  - __Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio__ = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share
    - Note, because the price of shares isn't the same as the amount invested, this isn't the same as Return on Equity.
    - This measures how confident the market is in a stock.
      - Lower means the stock is valued less than the earnings.
        - undervalued for a reason, maybe not
      - High means the stock is valued more than its earnings.
        - maybe it's overvalued for a reason, maybe not
  - __Dividend Yield Ratio__ = Dividends per Share / Market Price per Share
    - This tells how much you can expect to make on your investment.
  - __Stock Price Return__ = (Market Price<sub>1</sub> - Market Price<sub>0</sub> + Dividends) / Market Price<sub>0</sub>
    - Market Price<sub>1</sub> = the market price at the end of the year
    - Market Price<sub>0</sub> = the market price at the beginning of the year
    - Measures the pre-tax performance of an investment for a shareholder.

#### Summary of Financial Ratios and Company Ratio Profiles

- Always consider all the rations, not just one.
  - Appendix 5A gives a way to do this.

- The ratios vary greatly between different companies

## Additional Areas of Financial Statement Analysis

- When analyzing financial statements, consider:
  - The business environment
  - The foot notes
  - earnings quality

## Assessing the Business environment

- Business environment includes the:
  - strategy
  - operations
  - business model
  - industry (competitors)
    - see moodys.com, valueline.com, smallbusiness.dnb.com (Dun & Broadstreet), the wall street journal, and Standard & Poor's (spglobal.com)
  - suppliers and customers (politics)
  - economy

## Reading and Studying the Financial Statements and Footnotes

- After you understand the business environment, you can analyze financial statements.

- Financial statement analysis consists of:
  - reading the audit report
  - identifying significant transactions and the company's important segments
  - reading the income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of shareholders' equity, and footnotes.

### The Audit Report

- A __standard audit report__ will state that:
  - financial statements are accurate, fair, and conform to GAAP
  - the company has effective internal controls
  - tests were performed to ensure these statements

- A non-standard report could:
  - present going concern issues

- Remember, small private companies aren't required to be audited.
  - The accounting community is considering not using GAAP for small businesses because it's too complex. They might use IFRS or "Little GAAP"

### Significant Transactions and Important Segments

- Examples of transactions and events that could affect earnings and cash flows:
  - acquisitions
  - dicontinuance or disposal of a business segment
  - litigation
  - major write-downs of receivables or inventories
  - tender offers (share buybacks)
  - extraordinary gains or losses
  - changes of the accounting methods

- You can find these events and transactions in the footnotes of the annual report.

- Financial affects of events and transactions can be seen in the financial statements, primarily the income statement.
- __Earnings persistence__: the extent to which an income statement item reported in the current period can be expected to reflect future income levels.
- Companies report revenue, profit, and assets of individual __business segments__ to give investors a more detailed depiction of the business.

### Financial Statements and Footnotes

- Different types of business's financial statements and related footnotes will be very different. For example:
  - retailers sell inventory, so inventory turnover is king
  - banks loan capital, so receivables turnover is king
  - Software companies perform R&D, so return on assets and other ratios that tell how effective they are at creating products from R&D are king.
    - Mergers and Aquisitions are also important here
  
## Assessing Earnings Quality

- __Earnings quality__: how much reported financial statements deviate from the true financial condition and performance of the company.
- Here they discuss 4 ways managers often manipulate financial statements

### Overstating Operating Performance

- __Overstating performance__ makes financial statements look good
- Often smaller companies or companies facing financial difficulties will accelerate the recognition of revenues or defer the recognition of expenses to attract capital investments
- *Business week* wrote "Earnings Hocus-Pocus" about how accounting practices become "aggressive" when companies face economic challenges

### Taking a Bath

- To __take a bath__ means to over-report poor performance in poor years to hide a downward trend over time.
  - This can also be used to hide future losses, like uncollectable receivables
  - Companies will also match all their expenses against the bath period, instead of properly accruing them

### Creating Hidden Reserves

- In years of good performance, earnings are under recorded to create __hidden reserves__. Hidden reserves are then used to cushion poor performance.
  - This abuses the conservatism principal

- The techniques of this are the same as taking a bath.

### Employing Off-Balance-Sheet Financing

- __off-balance-sheet financing__: Financing activities that aren't reported on the balance sheet
  - makes a company look less risky
  - You can sometimes find this in the footnotes. Look for:
    - Accounting methods choosen.
      - IFRS is principles based, GAAP is rules based. Remember to look at overseas subsidiaries.
    - which areas are sensitive to manager's judgment and estimates

- Put yourself in the manager's shoes.
  - Investigate compensation incentives, the economic environment, debt covenants and the industry.

## Annual Report Information, Company Value, and projected Financial Statements

- The stock price is the best indicator of a company's future performance because it reacts to current news about the company.
- Financial statements have the largest impact on stock price.

- Best practices for predicting future stock price with financial ratios:
  - predict future sales
  - predict future profit margin
  - Based on sales predictions, estimate the level of assets necessary to support that level of sales
  - Choose a target financing mix (liabilities vs equity)

- These predictions are based on:
  - the information in the *Reading and Studying the Financial Statements and Footnotes* section namely:
    - past performance
    - current events (transactions...)
    - company segments
  - other information
    - company financing activities: dividends, equity issuances, stock buybacks
    - receivables/liabilities

- You can also predict future cash flows and shareholder's equity
