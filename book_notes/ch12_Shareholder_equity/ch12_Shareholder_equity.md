# Shareholders' Equity ch 12

- This chapter covers equity and:
  - it's purpose
  - how it's disclosed on the balance sheet

- Companies generate assets from 3 sources:
  1. borrowings (liabilities)
     - see chs 10 and 11
  2. Issuing equity securities (contributed capital)
     - important accounts include: Perferred stock, common stock, additional paid-in capital
     - __contributed capital__: contributions from a company's owners, consisting of 3 components: preferred stock, common stock,and additional paid-in capital.
  3. retaining funds generated through profitable operations. (Earned capital)
     - important accounts include: 
       - __earned capital__: assets that have been generated through profitable operations, and are not paid to owners in the form of dividends.
         - aka Retained earning
       - __Accumulated comprehensive income__: changes in the company's wealth that don't appear on the income statement and are not reflected in the balance of retained earnings.

- Assets = (1) Liabilities + (2) contributed Capital + (3) Earned Capital

- __Shareholders' equity__ is the investment made by the shareholder in the company
  - aka *net assets*, *book value*, or *net worth*.
  - I think this includes both contributed and earned capital

- GAAP vs IFRS disclose changes in comprehensive income as:
  - GAAP: a separate statement or part of the statement of changes in shareholder's equity
  - IFRS: a separate statement or an extension of the income statement
    - aka Statement of recognized income and exposure (SORIE)

- Equity funds the business

## The Relative Importance of liabilities, Contributed Capital, and Earned Capital

- Most companies use leverage as their primary funding source.

- Internet firms often don't use leverage because:
  - their stock premiums were high
  - They were rate of growth comes with uncertainty, which is bad for liabilities.
  - They have little collateral.

- Companies use stock buy-backs to reduce contributed capital

## Debt and Equity Distinguished

- This section discusses how creditors and shareholders differ. This distinction is important to investors, creditors, management and auditors

### Characteristics of Debt

- *creditor*: an outside party who loans the company money
  - aka *debtholder*

- creditors can use formal legal contracts to influence a company (see chs 10 and 11)

### Characteristics of Equity

- *shareholder*: the owner of a company visa via the purchase of issued stock.
  - aka *equity holder*

- unlike loans equity has:
  - no maturity date
  - no contract
  - dividends
    - Until declared, dividends are paid at the discretionary of the board, unlike mandatory interest payments.
    - unlike interest (an operating expense), dividends are considered a return on the owner's investment and hence not expenses. Dividends simply reduce retained earnings without affecting the income statement.
  - residual asset interest
  - provides stockholders get a vote for the board of directors

- The rights of shareholders come second to those of creditors
  - This is called a __residual interest__ in the company's assets


### Why is it Important to Distinguish Debt from Equity?

- The distinguishing debt from equity is important for different financial statement users

#### Debt vs. Equity: The Capital Provider's Perspective

- capital providers are shareholders and creditors.
- *debt security*: notes receivable and bonds
- *equity security*: stocks
- *active markets*: a market for the trade of security

##### Equity: Higher Risk

- Equity is riskier than debt.

- Debt often comes with:
  - regular interest and principal payments
  - security provisions
  - higher priority on remaining funds incase of bankruptcy.

##### Equity: Higher Returns

- stocks can produce high returns in the form of dividends and stock price appreciation.
- Debts produce low but stable returns in the form of interest.

#### Debt vs. Equity: Management's Perspective

- factors managers use to decide to issue stock or take loans:
  - interest rates
  - credit rating
  - debt to equity ratio
  - capital structure
  - economic conditions
  - industry

##### Debt: Contractual Restrictions

- restrictions of debt:
  - future payments
  - collateral
  - contracts might:
    - limit dividends
    - limit future borrowing
    - make requirements on benchmarks
      - for example: the current ratio, net income...

- larger amounts of debt often mean lower credit scores

##### Debt: Less Expensive

- interest is tax deductible
- When a company uses debt to generate returns for shareholders, it's called __leverage__

##### Equity: Dilution of Ownership

- __Dilution__: reducing the amount of ownership of the company each share grants by issuing more shares
  - diluting ownership dilutes votes, increasing the chances of a *takeover*

- __takeover__: when an outside investor purchases enough shares to have a controlling interest in the purchased company.
  - in a hostile takeover, the old board is ousted.
  - companies often keep outstanding stock low to avoid a takeover

- __treasury stock__: repurchased stock, held in a company's treasury for later reissuance.

### Debt vs. Equity: The Accountant's and Auditor's Perspective

- Accounting and debt vs equity:
  - debt and equity are disclosed in different parts of the balance sheet
    - debt in the liabilities section
    - equity in the shareholder's equity section
  - Debt affects the income statement, equity generally doesn't
    - interest and principle payments affect net income
    - dividends and reissuance of treasury stock don't affect net income

## Accounting for Shareholder's Equity

- 2 components of shareholder's equity:
  1. __contributed capital__: contributions of capital from shareholders.
     - Includes: perferred stock, common stock, and additional paid in capital
  2. __Earned capital__: the amount of assets earned and retained by the corporation.
     - Includes: retained earning and accumulated comprehensive income.

### Preferred Stock

- Perferred stock carries benefits common stock doesn't. It can either be:
  - __Preferred stock as to dividends__: if dividends are declared, these owners receive dividends
  - __Preferred stock as to assets__: if the corporation liquidates, these owners have higher priority over the assets.

#### Authorized, Issued and Outstanding Preferred Shares

- __Authorized__: number of shares a corporation is entitled to by issuing its corporate charter.
  - additional shares must be approved by the board, and are often subject to shareholder vote.

- __Issued__: shares that have been issued at one point, but may be outstanding or in the treasury.
- __Outstanding__: shares held by shareholders
- the annual report discloses the # of Authorized, Issued, and Outstanding shares.

#### Preferred Dividend Payments

- Preferred stock as to dividends often comes with terms requiring a specific annual dividend. This dividend is paid before dividends are paid to common stock shareholders.

- The amount of the preferred annual dividend payment is normally expressed as either:
  - an absolute dollar amount
    - for example: the holder of a $5 preferred stock will receive a $5 dividend.
  - a % of dollar amount referred to as the *par value of the preferred stock*.
    - for ex: the holder of a 4% preferred stock with a par value of $100 will receive 4$

#### Cumulative Preferred Stock

- With __cumulative preferred stock__, when a corporation misses a dividend:
  - __dividends in arrears__ are created in the amount of the preferred dividend.
  - In future periods, as dividends are declared, dividends in arrears are first paid to the preferred shareholders, who then receive their normal annual dividend.
  - Finally, common shareholders are paid from what remains.

- If the preferred stock is *noncumulative*, no dividends in arrears are created.

- dividends in arrears aren't liabilities, so they aren't listed on the balance sheet.
  - they must be disclosed on the financial report (footnotes?). High dividends in arrears are bad.

- most preferred stock is cumulative preferred stock, and dividends in arrears is rare.

#### participating Preferred Stock

- __participating__ preferred stocks have to the right to an annual dividend, and participate in dividends paid to common shareholders.
- The Extent to which the preferred shareholders participate is expressed as a par value of the perferred stock (see above)
- non-participating preferred stock doesn't participate in the common stock dividends.

#### Preferred Stocks: Debt or Equity?

- Preferred stocks are equity but resemble debt in the following ways:
  - have presidence over common stock in liquidations
  - specify annual dividend payments of a fixed amount (like interest)
  - are cumulative (like principle)
  - don't contain a participation feature.
  - don't have voting rights.
  - often contain a call provision allowing the company to buy the stock back.

- Because of these similarities, the IRS has allowed preferred dividends to be treated as interest and be recorded tax free.

- reporting location of preferred stock on the balance sheet is either:
  - at the top of the shareholders' equity section, immediately below long-term liabilities
  - sometimes it's disclosed as debt

- Sometimes preferred stock is treated as a liability in ratios.


### Common Stock

- 3 rights of common stock:
  1. profits and to receive dividends if they are declared by the board of directors
  2. a residual rights to the corporation's assets in case of liquidation
  3. the right to exert control over management, which includes the right to vote on board members and decisions

- This section describes different common stock terms: Market Value, Book Value, and a ratio of them

### Market Value

- __market value__: the price at which the stock can be exchanged on the market
  - common or preferred stock

### book value

- __Book value of Common Stock__ = (Shareholders' Equity - Preferred Capital) / (Number of Common Shares Held by the Shareholders)
- basically the book value of a single stock.
- often not correlated to actual common share price, because the balance sheet doesn't reflect the value of a company.

### Market-to-Book Ratio

- The __market-to-book__ ratio tells if the balance sheet reflects the company's value.

### Par Value

- The __par value__ (aka stated value) has no relationship to market or book value, and little economic significance.
- Sometimes corporations issue no-par common stock.

- Par value is used in accounting for certain stock transactions.
  - Many people think this is dumb, but that's irrelevant

## Accounting for Common and Preferred Stock Issuances

- Stock is accounted for when issued from the authorized pool.
  - note, not all issued stocks are outstanding, some issued stocks might be in treasury.

- accounting for issuing stock *without* a par value:
  - Debit cash (+A) for the full amount of cash received
  - Credit Common (or preferred) stock (+CC) for the full amount of the cash received

- accounting for issuing stock *with* a par value:
  - Debit Cash (+A) for the total amount of cash received
  - Credit Common (or preferred) stock (+CC) for the par value * number of shares
  - Credit Additional Paid-in capital common (or preferred) (+CC) for the remainder of the balance.

### Treasury Stock

- Repurchased outstanding common stock is either:
  1. held *in treasury*, awaiting reissuance at a later date
     - repurchased common shares are normally held in treasury.
     - shares held in treasury are authorized and unissued
  2. retired
     - repurchased preferred shares are normally retired.

- repurchases must be authorized and approved by the board of directors

#### Why Companies Purchase Treasury Stock

- Stock repurchases mean a company has less obligations to its owners.

- When less shares are outstanding, leveraging owners equity is easier because there's less of it.
  - remember, leverage is a determinant of return on equity (ROE). Less equity means more ROE

- treasury stock is often redistributed to employees as an incentive
- buybacks prevent hostile takeovers by increasing the proportionate control of remaining shareholders.
- statistically, companies that do buybacks outperform the market the following year
- companies also trade their own stock, buying low and selling high.
- treasury stock purchases also increase a company's earnings per share
- stock buybacks make outstanding shares more valuable because the outstanding shares represent a larger % ownership of the company. In this sense, shareholders outstanding shares don't own less of the company when a buyback happens, but they still sell the company back the stock for a profit.

#### Accounting for Treasury Stock: The Cost Method

- There are 2 methods of accounting for treasury stock:
  1. the cost method
     - this is covered below because it is simpler and more widely used (65% of companies)
  2. the par value method

##### Purchasing Treasury Stock

- When buying stock back, the following accounts are affected:
  - Debit Treasury Stock (-CC)
    - the Treasury Stock account is disclosed below retained earning in the shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet
  - Credit Cash (-A)

- Often, laws prevent companies from issuing dividends that exceed retained earnings less the cost of all shares held in treasury
  - dividend < RE - treasury
    - therefore, RE - treasury is the largest possible dividend.  
  - This protects investors and creditors by preventing companies from distributing too much cash dividends or buying back too much stock and failing.

- When companies retire treasury stock, they also reduce retained earnings. See these accounts:
  - Debit Retained Earnings (-RE)
  - Credit Cash (-A)

##### Reissuing Treasury Stock for More Than Acquisition Cost

- Account for reissuing at a premium by:
  - Debiting cash for the full amount of cash received (+A)
  - Credit the Treasury Stock (+CC) for the original cost paid when buying back
  - Credited the additional paid-in capital account (+CC) for the premium

#### Reissuing Treasury Stock for Less Than Acquisition Cost

- When reissuing treasury stock for less than acquisition cost:
  - normally:
    - Debit the cash account (A+) for the proceeds
    - Debit the Additional paid-in capital (-CC) for the difference
    - Credit treasury stock (+CC) for the acquisition cost
  - If the difference between the acquisition cost and the proceeds exceeds the balance in the additional paid-in capital account:
    - Debit the cash account (A+) for the proceeds
    - Debit the Retained Earnings (-CC) for the difference
    - Credit treasury stock (+CC) for the acquisition cost

- Note, treasury stock is a capital transaction and as such should not affect the income statement.

#### The Magnitude of the Treasury Stock Account

- Often, because companies pay a premium on stock buy-backs, the value of stock in treasury stock exceeds contributed capital.

### Stock Options

- __stock options__ give the owner the option to purchase stock at a given price for a given period of time.
  - If the market value of a stock increases during that time, the owner can buy at a lower price, then sell at a higher price. However, if the stock price drops, the owner doesn't loose any money.
  - This is a common compensation scheme for executives because it's an incentive to increase the stock price, it doesn't cost the corporation anything cash, it can create tax advantages and the recipient has a large upside with low risk.

- Because stock options are distributed from a company at a discount, the company must record these options as a compensation expense when issued.

#### Stock Option Compensation Expense

- Accounts affected by issuing Stock Options:
  - Debit Stock option compensation expense (E, -RE)
  - Credit Additional paid-in capital (+CC)

- They suggest using an "acceptable valuation formula" to calculate the stock option compensation expense per share, then multiplying it by the number of options for calculating the amounts for the above entires.
  - I imagine the "acceptable valuation formula" would be (projected price - current price)

- Stock option compensation expense increases shareholders' equity (additional paid-in capital - stock options) because the cost of an option is in the form of an investment made by the existing shareholders

#### Exercising Stock Options (with treasury stock shares for > acquisition)

- When accounting for exercising stock options with treasury stock shares for more than acquisition:
  - Debit Cash (+A) for the amount received for the stock
  - Debit Additional paid-in capital (-CC) for the premium paid for treasury stock shares on original purchase price
  - Credit treasury stock (+CC) for the original purchase price
  - Credit Additional paid-in capital (+CC) for the remaining balance
    - not sure what this is. They call it a "plug"
    - It ultimately can result in an ending balance in additional paid-in capital, which makes sense because stock options are essentially payments from owners equity to executives.

- In real accounting, options are accrued over the time the options are granted and when they can be executed.
- tech companies issue lots of options.
- options can reduce earnings
- The value of options is calculated by a complicated and controversial formula (because it requires predicting future price)

### Retained Earnings

- __Retained earnings__: previously recognized profits not yet paid to shareholders in the form of dividends.

- 2 factors affect the retained earnings balance:
  1. dividends
  2. appropriations

#### Dividends

- __Dividends__: Distributions of cash, property, or stock to shareholders.

- The Board declares dividends in a formal resolution (usually quareterly).
  - The amount is usually on a per share basis

- Types of dividends:
  - cash dividends
  - property dividends (dividends in kind) are distributions of property, usually debt or equity securities in other companies.
  - __Stock dividends__: distributing your own shares.

- Relevant dividends dates:
  1. __date of declaration__: date when the dividends are declared by the board
  2. __date of record__: determines who is to receive the dividend
  3. __date of payment__: when the distribution is made.

#### Dividend Strategy

- Factors in determining dividends:
  - the nature, financial condition, and desired image of a company, and legal constraints.
  - If paying cash dividends, companies must have unused cash

- Some companies ("growth companies") don't issue dividends, instead reinvesting the would-be dividends.
  - this reduces debt and dilutive equity issuances.

- Some companies issue some extra cash as dividends, but not all.

- Remember, RE - treasury is the largest possible dividend.
  - by law in most states

- debt contracts can also limit dividends.

#### Accounting for Cash Dividends

- on the *date of declaration*:
  - the board declares a dividend
  - a liability is recorded for the FMV of the dividend in the "dividends payable" account.\
    - accounts affected:
      - Debit Cash dividends (-RE) for the dividend per share * no. shares
      - Credit Dividends Payable (+L)

- At the end of the period:
  - close Cash dividends to retained earnings

- On the date of payment:
  - Close dividends payable to cash
  - accounts:
    - Debit Dividends Payable (-L)
    - Credit Cash (-A)

- Nothing is entry is recorded on the date of record, ownership of the dividend is just officially transferred.

#### Stock Splits and Stock Dividends

- Stock dividends and splits are similar because they both:
  - give shareholders additional shares
  - don't affect assets or liabilities

- __Stock split__: shares are split into smaller units and distributed.

- __Stock Dividend__: additional shares are expressed as a % of outstanding shares, are issued to the shareholder.
  - large stock dividends (over 25% of normal shares) are called __stock splits in the form of dividends__
  - dividends < 25% are called __ordinary stock dividends__

#### Accounting for Stock Dividends and Stock Splits

- Stock splits and dividends only affect accounts within the shareholders' equity section (i.e., common stock, additional paid-in capital,or retained earnings)

- 3 categories of split
  1. stock dividend (<25%)
  2. Stock splits in the form of dividends (>25%)
  3. Stock splits

##### Ordinary Stock Dividends

- Accounts affected:
  - Debit Stock Dividends (-RE) for the number of shares to be issued * FMV of the shares
  - Credit Common Stock (+CC) for number of shares issued * par value
  - Credit Additional Paid-In Capital (+CC) credited for remainder
    - unlike issuing treasury stock, if par is 0, everything is credited to Additional paid-in capital

- Remember, no assets or liabilities are involved in this transaction.

##### Stock Splits

- No entry is recorded, just record teh fact that there was a stock split, and par value is being reduced.
-
