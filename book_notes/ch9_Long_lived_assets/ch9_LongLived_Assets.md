# Ch 9 Long-Lived Assets

- Long-lived assets are depreciated

- Long-lived assets usually include:
  - Land: the cost of real estate used in the operation of the company
  - Fixed assets, for example:
    - buildings
    - machinery
    - equipment
  - Natural resource costs (the costs of acquiring the rights to extract natural resources)
    - often recorded in an account called property, plant, and equipment
  - Intangible assets: rights, privileges adn benefits of possession rather than physical existance.
  - deferred costs: miscellaneous intangible assets, often including prepaid expenses that provide benefits for a length of time that extends beyond the current period.

- Long-lived assets vary by company and industry. Examples:
  - real estate firms would record land as inventory
  - Boeing would consider planes as inventory, but United Airlines would consider planes a fixed asset.

- Long-lived assets are needed by companies to produce and sell goods and/or services. Strategic use of them is critical to a company's success.

- Long-lived asset turnover (sales/average long-lived assets) is a financial ratio used to asses how productive a company's long-lived assets are.
  - Higher ratios are better, but remember, this varies by industry.

## The Relative Size of Long-Lived Assets

- Industry break down of long-lived assets
  - large amounts of long-lived assets:
    - service providers. examples:
      - AT&T continually re-invests in emerging technology
      - Wendies continually adds and updates facilities
    - manufacturers
      - heavily rely on property, plant and equipment
    - retailers
      - must buy stores
  - small amounts of long-lived assets:
    - Internet firms
      - have electronic infrastructure
    - Financial institutions
      - their primary business is loans.

## Long-Lived Asset Accounting: General Issues and Financial Statement Effects

- __amortization__: the process of expensing capitalized long-lived assets over the course of their useful life using periodic adjusting entries.
  - Amortization derived from the matching principle that states revenues should be recorded against expenses from the same period.
  - __depreciation__: ammoritization of a fixed asset

- Amortization process:
  - First, capitalize the cost of acquiring the long-lived asset in the period of acquisition.
    - Debit equipment (+A), Credit Cash (-A)
  - Then, amortize (expense) the long-lived asset asset over the course of its useful life with adjusting journal entries.
    - There are various methods for calculating how much to record in adjusting journal entries.
      - In the __straight line method__:
        - each adjusting journal entry's value is the same amount.
        - adjusting journal entry amount = capitalized cost / number of periods
