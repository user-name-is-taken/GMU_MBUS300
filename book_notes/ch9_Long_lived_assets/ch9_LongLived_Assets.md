# Ch 9 Long-Lived Assets

- Long-lived assets are depreciated

- Long-lived assets usually include:
  - Land: the cost of real estate used in the operation of the company
  - Fixed assets, for example:
    - buildings
    - machinery
    - equipment
  - Natural resource costs (the costs of acquiring the rights to extract natural resources)
    - often recorded in an account called property, plant, and equipment
  - Intangible assets: rights, privileges adn benefits of possession rather than physical existance.
  - deferred costs: miscellaneous intangible assets, often including prepaid expenses that provide benefits for a length of time that extends beyond the current period.

- Long-lived assets vary by company and industry. Examples:
  - real estate firms would record land as inventory
  - Boeing would consider planes as inventory, but United Airlines would consider planes a fixed asset.

- Long-lived assets are needed by companies to produce and sell goods and/or services. Strategic use of them is critical to a company's success.

- Long-lived asset turnover (sales/average long-lived assets) is a financial ratio used to asses how productive a company's long-lived assets are.
  - Higher ratios are better, but remember, this varies by industry.

## The Relative Size of Long-Lived Assets

- Industry break down of long-lived assets
  - large amounts of long-lived assets:
    - service providers. examples:
      - AT&T continually re-invests in emerging technology
      - Wendies continually adds and updates facilities
    - manufacturers
      - heavily rely on property, plant and equipment
    - retailers
      - must buy stores
  - small amounts of long-lived assets:
    - Internet firms
      - have electronic infrastructure
    - Financial institutions
      - their primary business is loans.

## Long-Lived Asset Accounting: General Issues and Financial Statement Effects

- __amortization__: the process of expensing capitalized long-lived assets over the course of their useful life using periodic adjusting entries.
  - Amortization derived from the matching principle that states revenues should be recorded against expenses from the same period.
  - __depreciation__: ammoritization of a fixed asset

- Amortization process:
  - First, capitalize the cost of acquiring the long-lived asset in the period of acquisition.
    - Debit equipment (+A), Credit Cash (-A)
  - Then, amortize (expense) the long-lived asset asset over the course of its useful life with adjusting journal entries.
    - There are various methods for calculating how much to record in adjusting journal entries.
      - In the __straight line method__:
        - each adjusting journal entry's value is the same amount.
        - adjusting journal entry amount = capitalized cost / number of periods
        - Debit Depreciation Expense (E, -RE), Credit Accumulated Depreciation (-A)
      - In methods with an __accelerated rate__:
        - Larger depreciation expenses are recognized in earlier years with smaller depreciation expenses in later years.

- Sometimes some of the upfront cost of a long-lived asset is expensed up-front.
  - For example, painting a new car could be debited to Maintenance Expense (E, -RE) against a credit to Cash (-A) in the first period.

- Note:
  - larger capitalized costs reduce the size of the adjusting journal entries and vice versa.
  - longer amortization periods mean smaller adjusting journal entries.

## An Overview of Long-Lived Asset Accounting

- 3 important milestones in a long-lived asset's life:
  1. acquisition (purchased or manufactured)
  2. use
  3. disposal

## Acquisition: What Costs to Capitalize?

- The acquisition cost of a long-lived asset determined by either:
  1. The fair market value (FMV) of the asset
  2. The FMV of what is given up to acquire the asset
      - for example, the cash paid for the asset

- The acquisition cost should include all costs required to bring the asset into serviceable or usable condition and location.
  - Some costs (e.g., storage costs incurred while waiting to put an asset into service) are not required to bring the asset into usable condition and therefore should be expensed
  - This includes: freight, installation,taxes, and title fees

### The Acquisition of Land

- Costs required to acquire and bring land to a usable state include:
  - purchase price
  - closing costs, such as title, legal, and recording fees
  - costs incurred to get the land in condition for its intended use, such as: razing old building, grading, filling, draining and clearing (less any proceeds from the sale of salvaged materials)
  - assumptions of any back taxes, liens, or mortgages
  - additional land improvements assumed to be permanent, such as landscaping, streetlights, sewers, and drainage systems.

- The above costs are capitalized, but *not amortized* because amortization requires an estimate of a long-lived assets useful live and land has an infinite useful life.

- IFRS allows a special balance sheet land account called "investment property"
  - Investment property isn't used in operations
  - investment property is often rented, appreciates, then is sold.
  - IFRS dictates invenstment be valuated at cost or using mark-to-market accounting (current market value is recorded each period and are reflected in earnings)

- in GAAP, investment property is included in the land account, and must be carried at cost.

### Construction of Long-Lived Assets

- Companies that construct their own long-lived assets must allocate construction costs into long-lived asset accounts. These costs include:
  - materials
  - labor
  - overhead
  - interest on funds borrowed to finance construction

- Allocating interest and overhead can be complicated, and isn't covered here.

## Postacquisition Expenditures: Betterments or Maintenance?

- __Postacquisition expenditures__: costs incurred after an acquired or manufactured long-lived asset is placed into service.
  - __betterment__: a cost incurred to improve an asset.
    - betterments must meet at least one of the following 4 criteria:
      1. Increase the asset's useful life over that which was originally estimated.
      2. Improve the quality of the asset's output.
      3. Increase the quantity of the asset's output.
      4. Reduce the costs associated with operating the asset.
    - betterments are generally infrequent, non-periodic and expensive
    - betterments are capitalized, added to the cost of the long-lived asset, and amortized over its remaining useful life.
      - Often betterments that are immaterial are expensed because it makes accounting easier.
  - __maintenance__: a cost incurred to repair or maintain an asset
    - maintenance costs are generally periodic and inexpensive
    - maintenance costs should be treated as current expenses.

- Management can often exercise discretion when determining betterment vs maintenance.
  - WorldCom used this in their fraud.

## Cost Allocation: Amortizing Capitalized Costs

- allocate a long-lived asset's cost over the course of its useful life to match costs with benefits.

- 3 steps of the allocation process:
  1. estimate the useful life
  2. estimate the salvage value
  3. choose a cost allocation (depreciation) method

### Estimating the Useful Life and Salvage Value

- Factors like technical and physical obsolescence make estimating the useful life and salvage value of long-lived assets difficult. Because of this difficulty, GAAP offers no clear guidelines on determining the useful lives and future salvage values of long-lived assets.
  - __Salvage value__: the dollar amount that can be recovered when an asset is sold, traded, or scrapped.
  - __Physical obsolescence__: the point when an asset has deteriorated to the point that repairs are not economically feasible.
  - __Technical obsolescence__: when a new technology renders a working long-lived asset obsolete.

- In practice:
  - Companies assume a salvage value of $0
  - Companies use the IRS's estimates of useful life. However, these are only guidelines. There's significant discretion.
    - general guidelines:
      - Buildings and improvements: 10 - 50 years
      - Machinery and equipment: 3-20 years
      - Furniture and fixtures: 5-12 years
      - Automotive equipment: 3-6 years
  - Having a systematic and consistent way of estimating useful life and salvage value is important.
  - different companies in the same industry use different estimates

### Revising the Useful-Life Estimate

- Because revisions to useful-life not considered errors, they are treated *prospectively*, meaning there is no correcting adjusting entry when the useful life is changed. Depreciation expenses are just different amounts going forward.
- To revise a useful-life estimate simply: change the useful-life estimate, then depreciate the remaining balance of the depreciation base (cost - salvage value) over the remainder of the revised useful life.
- If useful-life estimate revisions result in a different net income than what's reported without revisions, the company must describe the revision in the footnotes.

### Cost Allocation (Depreciation) Methods

- The cost allocation methods discussed in this section determine the rate of amortization.
  - __rate of amortization__: the rate at which the depreciation is expensed over the useful life
    - __depreciation base__ = capitalized cost - salvage value
      - AKA depletion base for natural resources
      - AKA amortization base for intangibles
  
- 3 basic allocation (depreciation) methods allowed in GAAP:
  1. straight-line
  2. accelerated
  3. activity

#### The Straight-Line Method of Amortization (Depreciation)

- The __straight-line method__ amortizes equal amounts of the capitalized long-lived asset to each period of the asset's useful life.
  - per-period straight-line depreciation expense = depreciation base / Estimated useful life
    - estimated useful life is in number of periods (usually years)

- Reasons to choose the straight-line method:
  - assets provide equal benefits across their useful life
  - simplicity
  - net income is higher in early periods compared to other methods.

- straight line depreciation is often used to depreciate: building, intangible assets and other fixed assets

#### Double-Declining-Balance Method

- __Accelerated depreciation methods__ allocate greater amounts of the capitalized cost to early periods.
  - The double-declining-balance method is one example.

- per-period double-declining-balance method expense = (2 * Book Value) / estimated useful life
  - Book value = capitalized cost - accumulated depreciation
    - Note, salvage isn't part of the formula. Despite this, you still can't depreciate past the salvage value. Once you hit the salvage value, you just stop.

#### Straight-Line and Double-Declining-Balance Methods: A Comparison

- When compared to the straight-line methods, accelerated methods report lower net incomes in early years, then higher levels in later years.
- After depreciation ends, accelerated and straight-line methods end with the same accumulated depreciaton.
- Lockheed Martin uses accelerated for the first half of an asset's life followed by straight-line for the second half.

#### The Activity (Units-of-Production) Method and Natural Resource Depletion

- The __activity method__ allocates the cost of a long lived-asset to future periods based on its activity.
  - AKA the *units-of-production* method
  - When the long-lived assets are natural resources, the depreciation expenses in the activity method are said to __deplete__ the long-lived asset.
    - TODO: resolve the professor's comments
  - examples of activity: miles driven, units produced, barrels extracted
  - activity method deprecation expense amount per unit = cost of asset / number of long-lived assets

- Under IFRS, property, plant and equipment can be valued with mark-to-market if the market value can be reliably measured. These changes in fair market value are not reflected on the income statement, but rather affect a shareholder's equity account (the IFRS version of the statement of comprehensive income is called the statement of recognized income and expenses). IFRS companies rarely do this.

### Cost Allocation Methods and the Matching Principle

- By nature, the activity method is generally the best with respect to the matching principle.
  - There are situations where this isn't the case. For example: the rights do a song don't get depleted with number of listens.

- Consistent revenue to expense matching in general improves the quality and usefulness of reported financial numbers, but it's not the only consideration.

### How Does Management Choose an Acceptable Cost Allocation Method?

- Managers often choose a cost allocation method for its affect on net income. Net income in turn affects:
  - financial ratios like earnings per share, which are used by shareholders, investors and creditors
  - manager salaries (through incentives)
  - perception of the company.
    - note, changing to a less conservative method can bring negative perceptions.
  - debt covenants

- Although more conservative, accelerated methods can be used to create hidden reserves, and potentially fraud.

### Depreciation Methods for Income Tax Purposes

- Companies aren't required to use the same depreciation method for tax purposes that they use for financial statements.
- Companies often use accelerated methods and a shorter useful life for tax purposes because these methods reduce net-income more in early periods, thereby decreasing taxes in early periods and increasing the company's present value of money.

- The *Internal Revenue Code* defines the following shortest useful life and most aggressive accelerated depreciation methods for a long-lived asset by assigning it to one of the following 8 categories:
  |Category |Estimated Life|Allowable Depreciation Method|
  |---------|--------------|-----------------------------|
  |1        | 3 years      |Double-Declining-Balance     |
  |2        | 5 years      |Double-Declining-balance     |
  |3        | 7 years      |Double-Declining-Balance     |
  |4        | 10 years     |Double-Declining-Balance     |
  |5        | 15 years     |150% declining-balance       |
  |6        | 25 years     |150% declining-balance       |
  |7        | 27.5 years   |Straight-line                |
  |8        | 31.5 years   |Straight-line                |

- for example: cars are category 2; equipment and machienery can be category 1,2,3, or 4; buildings are generally category 7 or 8.

## Disposal: Retirements, Impairments, Sales, and Trade-Ins

- Long-lived assets can be disposed of through one of these processes: retirement, sale or trad-in.

- All asset disposal processes include the following steps:
  - The asset's depreciation is recorded to date of the disposal
  - The cost and accumulated depreciation (or *net cost*, in intangibles and natural resources) of the long-lived asset are removed from the books
    - This can get complicated when companies dispose of assets mid-period, but we don't cover that.
  - any receipt or payment of cash or other assets is recorded when the asset is disposed of
  - A gain or loss is recognized on the exchange in the amount of the difference between the book value of the asset and the net value of the receipt.
    - This is recorded in the "other revenues and expenses" section of the income statement.
  
- Note, depending on the depreciation methods, you might have to record a depreciation expense in the period of disposal.

### Retirement and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

- When long-lived assets are __retired__ (abandoned) their original cost and accumulated depreciation are simply written off the books. If the asset isn't fully depreciated, a loss is recognized.
  - Accounts affected by retirements:
    - if not fully depreciated, debit Loss on Disposal of ... (Lo, -RE) for the remaining book value of the asset
      - obviously book value because it's not being salvaged
    - Debit Accumulated Depreciation (+ A)
    - Credit Equipment (- A) for the capitalized cost of the asset

- Reasons to retire an asset: cost control, obsolescence, lack of a market, closure by a federal body, etc.

- Accounting for retirements is subjective and controversial.
  - GAAP requires the value of the asset be "permanently impaired"
  - Recent guidelines leave management leeway on the amount and timing of write-downs.
  - Like anything that affects net income, Asset write downs can be used for fraud.
  - Under IFRS, *impairment* changes on property, plant, and equipment are also recorded and reduce earnings. However, the criteria for when such charges should be recorded differ from U.S. GAAP, and the result is that under IFRS more frequent, but smaller, impairment charges are recorded. Also, under IFRS, recoveries from impairment charges recorded in prior periods serve to boost asset value and net income. These recoveries are not recognized under U.S. GAAP.

### Sale of Long-Lived Assets

- Selling long-lived assets is like retiring them, but you also record the cash received fro the exchange
  - Accounts affected by sales:
    - debit Cash (+A) for the cash received from the sale
    - Debit Accumulated Depreciation (+A) for the accumulated depreciation
    - Debit a Loss or credit a Gain on the Asset (Lo, +/-RE)
    - Credit the capitalized asset (-A)
  
### Trade-Ins of Long-Lived Assets

- With a __trade-ins__, two or more long-lived assets are exchanged, and cash is often received or paid.
- This book only covers exchanges of __dissimilar assets__, exchanges of similar assets are covered in intermediate accounting.

- Exchanged assets can be evaluated at either:
  - the FMV of the asset given up
    - This is usually subjective, requiring research. The asset's list price may not be accurate.
  - the FMV of the assets received
    - This is usually easier to determine.

- Accounts affected by exchanges of dissimilar assets:
  - Both long-lived capitalized asset's account (A)
  - debit the Accumulated Depreciation (+A)
  - debit or credit the Gain or Loss on the exchange (Lo, RE)
  - record the Cash paid or received (A)

- Trade-ins put you in a good bargaining position with car dealers

## Intangible Assets

- unrecognizable *intangibles*: features about a company that are valued by the market but ignored by the balance sheet.
  - examples: branding, supplier and customer relationships, company process and procedure assets, technical knowledge, etc.

- "price-to-book" ratio = company market value / company book value
  - used to measure intangibles

- Neither GAAP nor IFRS have good practices for recognition of intangibles because the standard of evidence for recognizing an asset is to high.

- This section will discuss recognizable intangibles.
  - recognizable intangibles must afford a company objectively measurable rights, privileges, and benefits of possession.
  - Evaluating intangibles is inherently less certain than evaluating tangibles.
  - examples: copyrights, patients, trademarks, trade names, licenses, and goodwill
  - When acquiring capitalize the cost of the intangible.
  - categories of intangibles:
    - definite life: patents, copyrights, trademarks
    - indefinite life: goodwill
      - not amortized, but could be subject to an impairment write-down.

### Copyrights, Patients, and Trademarks

- copyrights:
  - cover literary, musical or artistic works
  - last 70 years after the creator dies

- Patents:
  - are granted by the U.S. Patent office
  - give the holder exclusive rights to use, manufacture, or sale of a product or process for a period of 20 years

- trademarks:
  - a word, phrase, or symbol that distinguishes or identifies a particular enterprise or product.
  - granted by the U.S. Patent office
  - lasts 10 years, can be renewed indefinitely

### The Cost of Developing Computer Software

- *Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86* states: the cost of developing computer software should be amortized over the software's economic life.
  - Before this, these costs were expensed, resulting in low net income

### Goodwill

- When purchasing a company for more than the company's FMV of their assets and liabilities, record that excess cost in goodwill.
- CH 8 discussed this.

### Organizational Costs

- __organizational costs__ are costs a company incurs to start operations.
  - Ex: fees of underwriting, legal and accounting services, licenses, titles, and promotional expenditures.

- Although organizational costs are clearly incurred to generate future revenues, matching them against any specific revenue is impossible.
  - The only correct thing would be to match the organizational cost against the company's entire useful life, but the going concern assumption states this life is indefinite.
  - professional standards resolve this by requiring organizational costs to be expensed and providing guidelines on how to do this.

### Research and Development (R&D) Costs

- R&D costs are incurred to produce future revenues through the creation of a new product or process.
- It's often difficult to match specific R&D costs to specific products or processes. Sometimes R&D provides indirect and unforseen benefits.

- The FASB published *SFAS No. 2* in 1974 requiring R&D costs be expensed in the year incurred, rather than capitalized and amortized as intangible assets.
  - This makes things less subjective, but doesn't follow the matching principle
  - This discourages R&D because the impacts on the financial statements.

## IFRS vs. US GAAP
