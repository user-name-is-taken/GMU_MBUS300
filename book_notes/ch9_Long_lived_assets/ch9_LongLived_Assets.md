# Ch 9 Long-Lived Assets

- Long-lived assets are depreciated

- Long-lived assets usually include:
  - Land: the cost of real estate used in the operation of the company
  - Fixed assets, for example:
    - buildings
    - machinery
    - equipment
  - Natural resource costs (the costs of acquiring the rights to extract natural resources)
    - often recorded in an account called property, plant, and equipment
  - Intangible assets: rights, privileges adn benefits of possession rather than physical existance.
  - deferred costs: miscellaneous intangible assets, often including prepaid expenses that provide benefits for a length of time that extends beyond the current period.

- Long-lived assets vary by company and industry. Examples:
  - real estate firms would record land as inventory
  - Boeing would consider planes as inventory, but United Airlines would consider planes a fixed asset.

- Long-lived assets are needed by companies to produce and sell goods and/or services. Strategic use of them is critical to a company's success.

- Long-lived asset turnover (sales/average long-lived assets) is a financial ratio used to asses how productive a company's long-lived assets are.
  - Higher ratios are better, but remember, this varies by industry.

## The Relative Size of Long-Lived Assets

- Industry break down of long-lived assets
  - large amounts of long-lived assets:
    - service providers. examples:
      - AT&T continually re-invests in emerging technology
      - Wendies continually adds and updates facilities
    - manufacturers
      - heavily rely on property, plant and equipment
    - retailers
      - must buy stores
  - small amounts of long-lived assets:
    - Internet firms
      - have electronic infrastructure
    - Financial institutions
      - their primary business is loans.

## Long-Lived Asset Accounting: General Issues and Financial Statement Effects

- __amortization__: the process of expensing capitalized long-lived assets over the course of their useful life using periodic adjusting entries.
  - Amortization derived from the matching principle that states revenues should be recorded against expenses from the same period.
  - __depreciation__: ammoritization of a fixed asset

- Amortization process:
  - First, capitalize the cost of acquiring the long-lived asset in the period of acquisition.
    - Debit equipment (+A), Credit Cash (-A)
  - Then, amortize (expense) the long-lived asset asset over the course of its useful life with adjusting journal entries.
    - There are various methods for calculating how much to record in adjusting journal entries.
      - In the __straight line method__:
        - each adjusting journal entry's value is the same amount.
        - adjusting journal entry amount = capitalized cost / number of periods
        - Debit Depreciation Expense (E, -RE), Credit Accumulated Depreciation (-A)
      - In methods with an __accelerated rate__:
        - Larger depreciation expenses are recognized in earlier years with smaller depreciation expenses in later years.

- Sometimes some of the upfront cost of a long-lived asset is expensed up-front.
  - For example, painting a new car could be debited to Maintenance Expense (E, -RE) against a credit to Cash (-A) in the first period.

- Note:
  - larger capitalized costs reduce the size of the adjusting journal entries and vice versa.
  - longer amortization periods mean smaller adjusting journal entries.

## An Overview of Long-Lived Asset Accounting

- 3 important milestones in a long-lived asset's life:
  1. acquisition (purchased or manufactured)
  2. use
  3. disposal

## Acquisition: What Costs to Capitalize?

- The acquisition cost of a long-lived asset determined by either:
  1. The fair market value (FMV) of the asset
  2. The FMV of what is given up to acquire the asset
      - for example, the cash paid for the asset

- The acquisition cost should include all costs required to bring the asset into serviceable or usable condition and location.
  - Some costs (e.g., storage costs incurred while waiting to put an asset into service) are not required to bring the asset into usable condition and therefore should be expensed
  - This includes: freight, installation,taxes, and title fees

### The Acquisition of Land

- Costs required to acquire and bring land to a usable state include:
  - purchase price
  - closing costs, such as title, legal, and recording fees
  - costs incurred to get the land in condition for its intended use, such as: razing old building, grading, filling, draining and clearing (less any proceeds from the sale of salvaged materials)
  - assumptions of any back taxes, liens, or mortgages
  - additional land improvements assumed to be permanent, such as landscaping, streetlights, sewers, and drainage systems.

- The above costs are capitalized, but *not amortized* because amortization requires an estimate of a long-lived assets useful live and land has an infinite useful life.

- IFRS allows a special balance sheet land account called "investment property"
  - Investment property isn't used in operations
  - investment property is often rented, appreciates, then is sold.
  - IFRS dictates invenstment be valuated at cost or using mark-to-market accounting (current market value is recorded each period and are reflected in earnings)

- in GAAP, investment property is included in the land account, and must be carried at cost.

### Construction of Long-Lived Assets

- Companies that construct their own long-lived assets must allocate construction costs into long-lived asset accounts. These costs include:
  - materials
  - labor
  - overhead
  - interest on funds borrowed to finance construction

- Allocating interest and overhead can be complicated, and isn't covered here.

## Postacquisition Expenditures: Betterments or Maintenance?

- __Postacquisition expenditures__: costs incurred after an acquired or manufactured long-lived asset is placed into service.
  - __betterment__: a cost incurred to improve an asset.
    - betterments must meet at least one of the following 4 criteria:
      1. Increase the asset's useful life over that which was originally estimated.
      2. Improve the quality of the asset's output.
      3. Increase the quantity of the asset's output.
      4. Reduce the costs associated with operating the asset.
    - betterments are generally infrequent, non-periodic and expensive
    - betterments are capitalized, added to the cost of the long-lived asset, and amortized over its remaining useful life.
      - Often betterments that are immaterial are expensed because it makes accounting easier.
  - __maintenance__: a cost incurred to repair or maintain an asset
    - maintenance costs are generally periodic and inexpensive
    - maintenance costs should be treated as current expenses.

- Management can often exercise discretion when determining betterment vs maintenance.
  - WorldCom used this in their fraud.

## Cost Allocation: Amortizing Capitalized Costs

- allocate a long-lived asset's cost over the course of its useful life to match costs with benefits.

- 3 steps of the allocation process:
  1. estimate the useful life
  2. estimate the salvage value
  3. choose a cost allocation (depreciation) method

### Estimating the Useful Life and Salvage Value

- Factors like technical and physical obsolescence make estimating the useful life and salvage value of long-lived assets difficult. Because of this difficulty, GAAP offers no clear guidelines on determining the useful lives and future salvage values of long-lived assets.
  - __Salvage value__: the dollar amount that can be recovered when an asset is sold, traded, or scrapped.
  - __Physical obsolescence__: the point when an asset has deteriorated to the point that repairs are not economically feasible.
  - __Technical obsolescence__: when a new technology renders a working long-lived asset obsolete.

- In practice:
  - Companies assume a salvage value of $0
  - Companies use the IRS's estimates of useful life. However, these are only guidelines. There's significant discretion.
    - general guidelines:
      - Buildings and improvements: 10 - 50 years
      - Machinery and equipment: 3-20 years
      - Furniture and fixtures: 5-12 years
      - Automotive equipment: 3-6 years
  - Having a systematic and consistent way of estimating useful life and salvage value is important.
  - different companies in the same industry use different estimates

### Revising the Useful-Life Estimate

- Because revisions to useful-life not considered errors, they are treated *prospectively*, meaning there is no correcting adjusting entry when the useful life is changed. Depreciation expenses are just different amounts going forward.
- To revise a useful-life estimate simply: change the useful-life estimate, then depreciate the remaining balance of the depreciation base (cost - salvage value) over the remainder of the revised useful life.
- If useful-life estimate revisions result in a different net income than what's reported without revisions, the company must describe the revision in the footnotes.

### Cost Allocation (Depreciation) Methods

- The cost allocation methods discussed in this section determine the rate of amortization.
  - __rate of amortization__: the rate at which the depreciation is expensed over the useful life
    - __depreciation base__ = capitalized cost - salvage value
      - AKA depletion base for natural resources
      - AKA amortization base for intangibles
  
- 3 basic allocation (depreciation) methods allowed in GAAP:
  1. straight-line
  2. accelerated
  3. activity

#### The Straight-Line Method of Amortization (Depreciation)

- The __straight-line method__ amortizes equal amounts of the capitalized long-lived asset to each period of the asset's useful life.
  - per-period straight-line depreciation expense = depreciation base / Estimated useful life
    - estimated useful life is in number of periods (usually years)

- Reasons to choose the straight-line method:
  - assets provide equal benefits across their useful life
  - simplicity
  - net income is higher in early periods compared to other methods.

- straight line depreciation is often used to depreciate: building, intangible assets and other fixed assets

#### Double-Declining-Balance Method

- __Accelerated depreciation methods__ allocate greater amounts of the capitalized cost to early periods.
  - The double-declining-balance method is one example.

- per-period double-declining-balance method expense = (2 * Book Value) / estimated useful life
  - Book value = capitalized cost - accumulated depreciation
    - Note, salvage isn't part of the formula. Despite this, you still can't depreciate past the salvage value. Once you hit the salvage value, you just stop.

#### Straight-Line and Double-Declining-Balance Methods: A Comparison

- When compared to the straight-line methods, accelerated methods report lower net incomes in early years, then higher levels in later years.
- After depreciation ends, accelerated and straight-line methods end with the same accumulated depreciaton.
- Lockheed Martin uses accelerated for the first half of an asset's life followed by straight-line for the second half.

#### The Activity (Units-of-Production) Method and Natural Resource Depletion

- The __activity method__ allocates the cost of a long lived-asset to future periods based on its activity.
  - AKA the *units-of-production* method
  - When the long-lived assets are natural resources, the depreciation expenses in the activity method are said to __deplete__ the long-lived asset.
    - TODO: resolve the professor's comments
  - examples of activity: miles driven, units produced, barrels extracted
  - activity method deprecation expense amount per unit = cost of asset / number of long-lived assets

- Under IFRS, property, plant and equipment can be valued with mark-to-market if the market value can be reliably measured. These changes in fair market value are not reflected on the income statement, but rather affect a shareholder's equity account (the IFRS version of the statement of comprehensive income is called the statement of recognized income and expenses). IFRS companies rarely do this.

### Cost Allocation Methods and the Matching Principle

- By nature, the activity method is generally the best with respect to the matching principle.
  - There are situations where this isn't the case. For example: the rights do a song don't get depleted with number of listens.

- Consistent revenue to expense matching in general improves the quality and usefulness of reported financial numbers, but it's not the only consideration.

### How Does Management Choose an Acceptable Cost Allocation Method?

- Managers often choose a cost allocation method for its affect on net income. Net income in turn affects:
  - financial ratios like earnings per share, which are used by shareholders, investors and creditors
  - manager salaries (through incentives)
  - perception of the company.
    - note, changing to a less conservative method can bring negative perceptions.
  - debt covenants

- Although more conservative, accelerated methods can be used to create hidden reserves, and potentially fraud.

### Depreciation Methods for Income Tax Purposes

- Companies aren't required to use the same depreciation method for tax purposes that they use for financial statements.
- Companies often use accelerated methods and a shorter useful life for tax purposes because these methods reduce net-income more in early periods, thereby decreasing taxes in early periods and increasing the company's present value of money.

- The *Internal Revenue Code* defines the following shortest useful life and most aggressive accelerated depreciation methods for a long-lived asset by assigning it to one of the following 8 categories:
  |Category |Estimated Life|Allowable Depreciation Method|
  |---------|--------------|-----------------------------|
  |1        | 3 years      |Double-Declining-Balance     |
  |2        | 5 years      |Double-Declining-balance     |
  |3        | 7 years      |Double-Declining-Balance     |
  |4        | 10 years     |Double-Declining-Balance     |
  |5        | 15 years     |150% declining-balance       |
  |6        | 25 years     |150% declining-balance       |
  |7        | 27.5 years   |Straight-line                |
  |8        | 31.5 years   |Straight-line                |

- for example: cars are category 2; equipment and machienery can be category 1,2,3, or 4; buildings are generally category 7 or 8.
