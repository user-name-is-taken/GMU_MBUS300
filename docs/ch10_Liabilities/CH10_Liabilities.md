# Ch 10 Intro to Liabilities: Economic Consequences, Current Liabilities, and Contingencies

- __Liability__: obligations to disburse assets or provide services in the future
  - current liabilities
    - ex: short-term payables
  - Long-term liabilities
    - ex: long-term notes, bonds, leases, retirement costs (appendix A), and deferred income taxes (appendix B)

- contingent liabilities can be short or long term.
- Liabilities can be difficult to measure especially when companies have latitude in setting reserves (liabilities) for future costs.
- CH 11 covers using the *effective interest method* to account for long-term notes, bonds and leases.

## What Is a Liability?

- 3 characteristics of a liability:
  1. They require payments of goods or services in the future
  2. These payments are unavoidable
  3. The obligations to make these payments must have already been entered into.

- Examples of liabilities: credit balances with suppliers, debts from borrowings, services yet to be performed, witholdings from employees' wages and salaries, dividened declarations, product warranties, deferred income taxes, and certain financing arrangements.

- Later we'll discuss economic liabilities vs balance sheet liabilities

## The Relative Size of Liabilities on the Balance Sheet

- __debt ratio__ = liabilities / assets

- the size of the debt ratio varies by industry (higher means more debt per assets):
  - banks are high
  - car manufacturers are high
  - companies with large amounts of property, plant and equipment are high
  - Internet firms are generally low

## Reporting Liabilities on the Balance Sheet: Economic Consequences

- Many ratios used by financial statement users include debt as a figure.
  - For example, seven of Dun & Bradstreet's 14 key business ratios are:
    1. quick ratio = ([cash + marketable securities + receivables] / current liabilities)
    2. current ratio = (current assets / current liabilities)
    3. current liabilities / net worth
    4. current liabilities / inventory
    5. total liabilities / net worth
    6. sales / net working capital
    7. accounts payable / sales
  - These ratios are used to: determine credit ratings, assess solvency and future cash flows, predict bankruptcy, and assess financial health.

### Shareholders and Investors

- __leverage__: using debt to generate revenue
  - attracts shareholders because they don't have to invest to get returns.
  - interest is tax deductible
  - this strategy is risky

- Creditors take precidence over investors
  - If interest isn't paid, companies can't distribute dividends.
  - On liquidity, creditors are paid first.

### Creditors

- __Creditor__: a person or company to whom money is owed

- debt covenants are conditions creditors include on loans.
  - for example: collateral, restricting future borrowing, restricting more stock issuing, restricting selling assets, restricting mergers or requiring certain ratios be maintained.

### Management

- Pros of debt:
  - provides cash for OIF activities

- cons of debt:
  - puts demands on your cash
  - negatively affects credit rating
  - negatively affects financial ratios
    - managers care about this (incentives)!
    - companies use this to "take a bath" in bad years or build "hidden reserves" in good years
  - covenants

### Auditors

- Auditors are responsible for verifying that all liabilities are identified and reported.

## Current Liabilities

- __Current liabilities__: obligations expected to require use of current assets or the creation of other current liabilities.
  - obligations due within a year may not be current if:
    1. they're expected to be paid from non-current assets
    2. They're expected to be refinanced with long-term liabilities or equity issuances.
  
- ex: obligations to suppliers, short term debts, current maturites on long-term debts, dividends payable to shareholders, deferred revenues (services or goods yet to be performed that use a current asset), third-party collections (e.g., sales tax and payroll deductions), periodic accurals (e.g., wages and interest

### The Relative size of Current Liabilities on the Balance sheet

- *Current liabilities / Total liabilities* tells how much you're financing with current vs total liabilities
- internet companies and banks often have relatively high current liabilities, where oil companies have relativley low current liabilites (plant, prop and equipment loans are long term).

### Valuing Current liabilities on the Balance Sheet

- The difference between __face value__ and __present value__ of current liabilities is often assumed immaterial, and the current liability is simply reported at face value
  - __face value__: The cash payment due to fulfill the liability
  - __present value__: the discounted future cash payment to fulfill the liability

### Reporting Current Liabilities: An Economic Consequence

- Accurate reporting of *all* current liabilities is especially important because current liabilities are used in a lot of ratios

## Determinable Current liabilities

- Liabilities can be determinable or contingent depending on how certain future payments are.

- __determinable current liabilities__ can be precisely measured with a fairly certain date of payment.
  - examples of determinable liabilities: accounts payable, short-term debts, dividends payable, unearned revenues, third-party collections, and accrued liabilities

### Accounts Payable

- Accounts payable (aka trade accounts payable) are dollar amounts owed to others for goods, supplies, and services purchased on __open account__.
  - Accounts payable transactions are frequent and informal
  - Accounts payable often result from the time lag between receiving a payment and fulfilling an obligation.

- Small businesses use accounts payable a lot.
- high amounts of accounts payable can affect solvency

### Short-Term Debts

- Short term debts (aka short-term borrowings) includes:
  - __Commercial paper__: short-term notes (30 - 270 days) issued by companies with good credit ratings to other companies
  - __Lines of credit__: money borrowed from a bank, with interest due on the outstanding balance
  - current maturities of long-term debts

- short-term debts are indicative of solvency, and hence described extensively in the foot notes.

#### Short-Term Notes

- Short-term notes include:
  - __Maturity date__: when the loan is due
  - __Interest__: the difference in the cash the borrower received and the balance due (*face amount*) to the lender

- accounts affected when borrowing short-term notes:
  - debit Cash (+A)
  - debit Discount on Notes Payable (-L)
    - This contra account represents the interest that's not yet owed, but will be in the future.
  - credit Notes Payable (+L)

- Accounts affected when accruing the interest on short-term notes:
  - Debit Interest Expense (E, -RE)
  - Credit Discount on Notes Payable (+L)

#### Current Maturities of Long-Term Debts

- Current Maturities of long-term debts are installments (payments portions) of long-term debts that are due within a year, or the current operating cycle, whichever is longer.
  - this definition of current is the same for current assets

- Current Maturities of long-term debts are recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities.
- The non-current portions of long-term debts remain as long-term liabilities.

### Dividends Payable

- Dividends are:
  - recorded when declared. (this might be wrong)
  - due in the current period.

### Unearned Revenues

- __Unearned revenue__: revenues received before contracted services are performed.
  - aka: deferred revenue or receipt in advance

- Unearned revenues are liabilites because:
  - they require a service to be performed
  - the earnings process isn't complete when the revenue is received, which is a criteria for revenue recognition.

- Unearned revenues are current if they will be earned with current assets.
- examples: gift cards, cupons, tickets, subscriptions, discounts from membership programs, and returnable deposits.

- Accounts affected by creating unearned revenues (cash is received):
  - Debit cash (+A)
  - Credit Unearned Revenue (+L)

- accounts affected when revenue is earned:
  - Debit Unearned Revenue (-L)
  - Credit Service Revenue(R, +RE)

### Third-Party Collections

- Third-Party collections are recorded when an organization collects money on behalf of another entity. The collected cash is a liability.
  - This liability is often current.

- ex:
  - taxs:
    - sales tax
    - employee social security withholdings
    - employee income tax withholdings
  - other:
    - union dues
    - insurance premiums
  
- Accounts affected by collection:
  - Debit cash (+A)
  - Credit the witholding account (+L)
  - Credit the account the cash is being withheld from (R, +RE)

- Accounts affected upon paying the withholding to the third-party:
  - Debit the withholding account (-L)
  - Credit Cash (-A)

### Income Tax liability

- __Income tax__: A percentage (~35%) of income paid to the government.
- At the beginning of the year, corporations estimate how much income tax they must pay and record it as a liability. This liability is usually paid off quarterly.

### Incentive Compensation

- __Incentive compensation__: linking employee benefits to performance metrics
  - common benefits:
    - stock
    - cash
  - Common metrics:
    - net income
    - stock price (market value)

- Managers and executives often get incentive based stock options and bonuses, while lower level employees have the opportunity to participate in profit sharing.
- There's often a cap on how large these benefits can be
- Incentive compensations are current liabilities because they are paid at the end of the period when the metrics can be evaluated.

- Accounts affected by accruing incentive compensation:
  - Debit Bonus Expense (E, -RE)
  - Credit Bonus Liability (+L)

- Accounts affected by paying incentive compensation:
  - Debit Bonus Liability (-L)
  - Credit Cash (-A)

- Managers sometimes manipulate the metrics through: operating decisions, choices of accounting methods, estimates, assumptions, the time of accruals, or even intentional misstatements.
  - for example, overlooking expenses, postponing R&D ...
  - managers have an incentive to manipulate the metrics.
  - remember, accounting manipulations normally reverse themselves over time, and are seen as unethical.

## Contingencies and Contingent Liabilities

- __Contingency__: "an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occurs or fails to occur." (FASB)
  - __Gain contingency__: "possible gain" resulting in a decrease in liabilities or increase in assets
  - __Loss contingency__: "possible loss" resulting in an increase in liabilities or decrease in assets.

### Contingent Liabilities: A Scenario

- 3 ways to handle contingencies:
  1. Ignore them
     - if auditors allow this option without disclosing it in their notes, they can be liable for it.
     - This choice isn't conservative
     - Management might have an incentive  to do this, but it's fraud.
  2. Disclose them in the footnotes
     - Disclose all the information about the contingency.
     - This won't affect reported financial statements.
  3. recognize (accruing) them and describe them in the footnotes
     - Accounts affected by accruing:
       - Debit contingent Loss (or gain) (Lo, -RE)
       - Credit contingent liability (+L)
     - Accounts affected by paying:
       - Debit Contingent Liability (-L)
       - Credit Cash (-A)
     - Contingent gain or loss affects net income, which is adjusted to shareholder's equity.
       - Remember, management has incentives to manipulate income
     - Contingent liability Current if payments are made with current assets
     - This might look like the contingency is probable.
     - Accruing in the current period is conservative for contingent losses.
     - accruing in the current period releaves you from accruing in future periods.

### Accounting for Contingencies

- Accounting for contingencies depends on: if it's a gain or loss contingency, and how probable the contingency is to materialize.
  - This info is from FASB standard No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies"

#### Gain contingencies

- This flow chart describes accounting for contingent gains.
- Note contingent gains are almost never Accrued on the financial statement, and are only rarely disclosed in footnotes.
- Contingent gains are only recognized when realized. This is consistent with the objectivity principle and the conservatism concept by avoiding subjective estimates.

#### Loss Contingencies

- Contingent losses are more often disclosed than contingent gains, because of conservatism.

![Loss contingencies](./ContingentLossChart.png)

- Probabilities and (sometimes) dollar amount estimates are usually assessed by outside experts

- when dollar amount estimates are made, ranges of certainty for the dollar amounts are included in the footnotes
  - If an estimate can't be agreed on, the lowest amount in the range is used.

- In IFRS, "best estimate" means "reasonable estimate", liabilities are recorded at the present value of future outflows, and the liability is referred to as a "provision"
- examples of highly probable contingent losses: environmental fees, bad debts, warranties

#### Warranties: Accrued Loss Contingencies
