# Appendix A The Time Value of Money

- Valuation helps assess solvency and earnings power.
- assets and liabilities are reported at present value.

- __present value__: the economic value of an asset or liability.
  - to compute present value, future cash inflows and outflows associated with an asset or liability are predicted and then adjusted in a way that reflects the *time value of money* (ie., a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today)
  - interest is a good way to think about how the present value and the future value are different.

- Money held today is worth more than money in the future.
- They also talk about compound interest here.
