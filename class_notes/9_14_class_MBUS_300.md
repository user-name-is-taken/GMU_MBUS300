- Assumptions:
  - __Economic entity__: a company's financials must be separate from the owner's personal assets.
  - __Fiscal period__: The economic activity can be broken down into periods (fiscal year is 12 months)
    - you must be able to count your inventory at the end of the fiscal period. Hence some companies end their fiscal year when inventory is steady.
  - __Going Concern__: a corporation lives forever
    - Going concern report?
  - __stable Dollar__: money is used to measure value. A stable money must be used. Only monitary transactions are recorded.

- historical cost vs fair value:
  - __historical cost__: the origional cost (or how much it would have cost)
  - __Fair value__: the current cost (how much you could sell it for)
    - only for some assets in some industries

- with inventory: lower of cost or market (LCM)

- we're accrule based accounting (not cash based)

  - for goods, title has transferred, for services, service was performed.
  - Cash collection can be expected

- GAAP is specalized to each industry
- unearned revenues are a liability
- cash and revenue aren't the same
- only record income when the revenue is recognized!

- consistency: companies must follow the same methods every period
  - If they change methods, you must disclose it!

- Materiality: large transactions (and mistakes...) are material. They must be listed on the financial statements.
  - The less material an item is, the more flexibility you have on reporting it.

- Conservatism: when in doubt
  - understate assets
  - overstate liabilities
  - delay recognition of ganis
  - Accelerate recognition of losses

- IFRS is principles based, GAAP is rules based
  - IFRS allows management more lee-way
